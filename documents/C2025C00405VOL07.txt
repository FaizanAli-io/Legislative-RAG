Division 315 Demutualisation of private health insurers

Section 315-210
Step 3.

The result of step 2 is the first element of the *cost base
and *reduced cost base of the asset, unless the asset is a
right.

Step 4.

If the asset is a right, multiply the result of step 2 by the
number of shares that can be *acquired under the right.
The result is the first element of the *cost base and
*reduced cost base of the asset.

Example: Wellbeing Health demutualises on 1 April 2008 and has a market
value of $400 million on that day. It distributes its accumulated
mutual surplus in the form of rights to acquire shares in its holding
company Healthiness Insurance Ltd (Healthiness). The rights do not
have an exercise price.
A total of 800 million shares can be acquired in Healthiness under
rights issued under the demutualisation. Each right allows the holder
to acquire 50 shares. No shares in Healthiness are issued.
Under the method statement, the first element of the cost base and
reduced cost base of each right is worked out by dividing the market
value of Wellbeing Health (step 1) by the number of shares in
Healthiness that can be acquired under the demutualisation (step 2)
and multiplying the result by the number of shares that can be
acquired under the right (step 4):

$400 million
 50  $25
800 million

Acquisition rule
(3) The participating policy holder or trustee is taken to have *acquired
the *CGT asset at the time it is issued.

(b) the event involves:
(i) the variation or abrogation of rights attaching to or

Effects of CGT events happening to interests and assets in trust
316-160 Disregarding beneficiaries’ capital gains and losses, except
some involving receipt of money
Disregard a *capital gain or *capital loss of a beneficiary of the lost
policy holders trust from a *CGT event that happens to the
beneficiary’s interest in the trust.

316-165 Taking account of some capital gains and losses involving
receipt of money by beneficiaries
(1) This section applies if:
(a) a *CGT event happens to an interest of a beneficiary of the
lost policy holders trust in that trust; and
(b) the *capital proceeds from the event include or consist of
money received by the beneficiary.
(2) Work out whether the beneficiary makes a *capital gain or *capital
loss from the *CGT event, and the amount of the gain or loss,
assuming that:
(a) the *capital proceeds from the CGT event were the amount
they would be if they did not include any *market value of

In many cases, income from demutualisation is assessed through
the CGT provisions rather than as ordinary income or other
statutory income.
Franking debits arise for the friendly society and its subsidiaries to
ensure they do not enjoy a franking surplus. Franking debits and
credits arise to negate credits and debits from things attributable to
the time before demutualisation.

income.
Those rules:

Section 320-1
•

include certain amounts in assessable income;

•

identify certain amounts of exempt income and non-assessable
non-exempt income;

•

identify specific deductions.

Life insurance companies can have one or both of these taxable
incomes for any income year for the purposes of working out their
income tax for that year:
•

a taxable income of the complying superannuation class,
which consists of taxable income that relates to complying
superannuation business, and is taxed at the rate of tax that
applies to complying superannuation funds;

•

a taxable income of the ordinary class, which consists of
taxable income that relates to other businesses and is taxed at
the corporate tax rate.

Life insurance companies can also have tax losses that correspond
to those 2 classes. The Division provides that tax losses of a
particular class can be deducted only from incomes in respect of
that class.
The Division ensures that the income tax worked out on the basis
of these taxable incomes and tax losses is a single amount of
income tax on one taxable income.
The Division also contains rules for segregating the assets of life
insurance companies into:
•

assets that relate to complying superannuation business;

•

assets that relate to immediate annuity and other exempt
business.

on the taxable income of a life insurance company to be
worked out.
Note:

Section 320-5 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997
provides that the tax consequences of certain transfers of assets of a
life insurance company that is a friendly society to a complying
superannuation fund are to be disregarded.

Section 320-131
(a) a taxable income of the complying superannuation class
and/or a taxable income of the ordinary class; or
(b) a tax loss of the complying superannuation class and/or a tax
loss of the ordinary class; or
(c) a taxable income of one class and a tax loss of the other class.
Note:

The taxable incomes mentioned in paragraph (a) are taxed at different
rates: see section 23A of the Income Tax Rates Act 1986.

(2) Taxable incomes and tax losses of both classes are taken into
account in working out the amount of income tax that the company
has to pay for the income year (see section 320-134). That amount
is then taken to be the income tax on the company’s taxable
income for that income year.
Working out taxable income and tax loss of each class
(3) In general, the rules in this Act about working out a company’s
taxable income or tax loss, or deducting a company’s tax loss,
apply to a life insurance company in relation to:
(a) working out a taxable income or tax loss of a particular class;
or
(b) deducting a tax loss of a particular class.
(4) However, that general rule is subject to the following:
(a) sections 320-137 to 320-143, which allocate amounts of
incomes and deductions for the purposes of working out a
taxable income or tax loss of a particular class;
(b) subsections 320-141(2) and 320-143(2), which provide that
tax losses of a particular class can be deducted only from
incomes in respect of that class;
(c) section 320-149, which sets out the provisions in this Act that
have effect only in relation to a taxable income or tax loss of
the ordinary class.

deducted only from its incomes in respect of that class;
and
(b) for the purposes of this Act, that amount of income tax is

Section 320-134
320-134 Income tax of a life insurance company
Working out the income tax
(1) Work out a *life insurance company’s income tax for an income
year under section 4-10 as follows:
(a) apply steps 1 and 2 of the method statement in
subsection 4-10(3) to work out separately the amount that
would be the company’s basic income tax liability for its
taxable income of each *class for that year;
(b) treat the sum of these amounts as the company’s basic
income tax liability for that year and apply step 4 of the
method statement to subtract its *tax offsets from that sum.
(2) For the purposes of this Act:
(a) the income tax worked out in accordance with subsection (1)
is taken to be the company’s income tax on its taxable
income for the income year; and
(b) except as provided by subsection (1) of this section and
sections 320-135 to 320-149, the company’s taxable income
for that year is taken to be equal to the sum of the company’s
taxable incomes of the 2 *classes for that year.
Note:

This means that there is only one assessment in respect of the
company’s taxable income for the income year and that the income
tax constitutes only one debt to the Commonwealth.

Working out the income tax on certain assumptions
(3) Subsection (1) also has effect in relation to working out an amount
that would be the company’s income tax if certain assumptions
were made. It has that effect in the same way as it has effect in
relation to working out the company’s income tax under
section 4-10 (except in regard to those assumptions).
Note:

This means, for example, subsection (1) also has effect in relation to
working out the amount of a life insurance company’s income tax on
the basis of the tax offset priority rules in Division 63.

much of that result as the company expects at the end of
the income year to recover under a reinsurance contract:

within the meaning of that standard; but

(b)

that is not one to which subsection 148(1) of the

This Division explains the meaning of the terms small business

If you are a small business entity, this Division allows you to
change the way the income tax law applies to you in these ways:
(a) you can choose to put your depreciating assets into a
general pool and treat the pool as a single asset
(Subdivision 328-D);
(b) you can choose not to account for annual changes in
trading stock value that are not more than $5,000
(Subdivision 328-E).
In usual circumstances, these changes will simplify the working
out of your taxable income, and so reduce your compliance costs.

(1) The main object of this Division is to offer eligible small
businesses the choice of a new platform to deal with their tax. The
platform is designed to benefit those businesses in one or more of
these ways:
• reducing their tax;
• providing simpler rules for determining their income and
deductions;
• providing simpler capital allowances and trading stock
requirements;
• reducing their compliance costs.
(2) This Division also provides rules that are intended to prevent other
businesses from taking advantage of those benefits.

Guide to Subdivision 328-D
328-170 What this Subdivision is about
If you are a small business entity, you can choose to deduct
amounts for most of your depreciating assets on a diminishing
value basis using a pool that is treated as a single depreciating
asset.
Broadly, the pool is made up of the costs of the depreciating assets
that are allocated to it or, in some cases, a proportion of those
costs.
The pool rate is 30%.
There is a deduction for assets whose cost is less than $1,000 in the
income year in which you start to use the asset or have it installed
ready for use.
This Subdivision sets out how to calculate the pool deductions, and
also sets out the consequences of:
(a) disposal of depreciating assets; and
(b) not choosing to use this Subdivision for an income year
after having chosen to do so for an earlier income year;
and
(c) changing the business use of depreciating assets.

are not a *small business entity or do not choose to use this
Subdivision.

328-185 Pooling
(1) If you are a *small business entity for an income year and you have
chosen to use this Subdivision for that year, you deduct amounts
for your *depreciating assets (except assets for which you have
deducted or can deduct an amount under section 328-180) through
a pool, which allows you to deduct amounts for them as if they
were a single asset, thereby simplifying your calculations. You use
one rate for the pool.
(2) There is a general small business pool to which *depreciating
assets are allocated.
Allocating assets to a pool
(3) A *depreciating asset:
(a) that you *hold just before, and at the start of, the first income
year for which you are, or last were, a *small business entity;
and
(b) for which you calculate your deductions under this
Subdivision instead of under Division 40; and
(c) that has not previously been allocated to your *general small
business pool; and
(d) that you have started to use, or have *installed ready for use,
for a *taxable purpose;
is automatically allocated to your general small business pool.
(4) A *depreciating asset that you start to use, or have *installed ready
for use, for a *taxable purpose during an income year for which
you are a *small business entity and you choose to use this
Subdivision is allocated to the *general small business pool at the
end of that year.

*general small business pool if you started to use it, or have it
*installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose before 1 July 2001.
Note:

If you make this choice, you would continue to deduct amounts for the
asset under Division 40.

(6) You must make that choice for the first income year for which you
are a *small business entity and you choose to use this Subdivision.
Once you have made the choice for an asset, you cannot change it.
No re-allocation
(7) Once a *depreciating asset is allocated to your *general small
business pool, it is not re-allocated, even if you are not a *small
business entity for a later income year or you do not choose to use
this Subdivision for that later year.
Note:

If you chose to use this Subdivision for an income year, you continue
to use it for your general small business pool for a later income year
even if you are not a small business entity, or do not choose to use this
Subdivision, for the later year: see section 328-220.

328-190 Calculation
(1) You calculate your deduction for your *general small business pool
for an income year using this formula:
*Opening pool balance  30%

A transferor does not subtract anything for certain balancing

under section 40-340 is chosen: see sections 328-243 and 328-245.

328-205 Estimate of taxable use
(1) You must, for the first income year for which you are, or last were,
a *small business entity, make a reasonable estimate for that year
of the proportion you will use, or have *installed ready for use,
each *depreciating asset that you *held just before, and at the start
of, that year for a *taxable purpose if:
(a) the asset has not previously been allocated to your *general

Subdivision.
Note 1:

That proportion will be 100% for an asset that you expect to use, or
have installed ready for use, solely for a taxable purpose.

Note 2:

Your estimate will be zero for an income year if another provision of
this Act denies a deduction for that year: see section 328-230.

Note 3:

This subsection does not apply to a transferee for certain assets if
roll-over relief under section 40-340 is chosen: see sections 328-243
and 328-257.

(2) You must also make this estimate for each *depreciating asset that
you *hold and start to use, or have *installed ready for use, for a
*taxable purpose during an income year for which you are a *small
business entity and you choose to use this Subdivision. You must
make the estimate for the income year in which you start to use it,
or have it installed ready for use, for such a purpose.
(3) The taxable purpose proportion of a *depreciating asset’s
*adjustable value, or of an amount included in the second element
of its *cost, is that part of that amount that represents:
(a) the proportion you estimated under subsection (1) or (2); or
(b) if you have had to make an adjustment under section 328-225
for the asset—the proportion most recently applicable to the
asset under that section.
Note:

An amount included in the second element of the cost of a
depreciating asset is referred to in this Division as a cost addition
amount: see subsection 328-190(3).

(4) The taxable purpose proportion of a *depreciating asset’s
*termination value is that part of that amount that represents:
(a) if you have not had to make an adjustment under
section 328-225 for the asset—the proportion you estimated
under subsection (1) or (2); or
(b) if you have had to make at least one such adjustment—the
average of:
(i) the proportion you estimated under subsection (1) or
(2); and
(ii) the proportion applicable to the asset for each of the 3
income years you *held the asset after the one in which
the asset was allocated to the pool.
Example: When Bria’s computer was allocated to her general small business
pool for the 2012-13 income year, she estimated that it would be used
50% for her florist business. Due to increasing business, Bria
estimates the computer’s use to be 70% for the 2013-14 year, and 90%

for the 2014-15 year. She makes an adjustment under section 328-225
for both those years.
Bria sells the computer for $1,000 at the start of the 2016-17 income
year. She must now average the business use estimates for the
computer for the year it was allocated to the pool and the next 3 years
to work out the taxable purpose proportion of its termination value.
The average is worked out as follows:
•
50% (original estimate); plus
•
70% (2013-14 estimate); plus
•
90% (2014-15 estimate); plus
•
90% (no change on previous year);
=300% ÷ 4 = 75%
The taxable purpose proportion of the computer’s termination value is,
therefore:
75% of $1,000 = $750

328-210 Low pool value
(1) Your deduction for a *general small business pool for an income
year is the amount worked out under subsection (2) (instead of an
amount calculated under section 328-190) if that amount is less
than $1,000 but more than zero.
Note 1:

See section 328-215 for the result when the amount is less than zero.

Note 2:

This threshold may be affected by section 328-180 (about temporary
increased access to accelerated depreciation) or 328-181 (about
temporary full expensing) of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions)
Act 1997.

(2) The amount is the sum of:
(a) the pool’s *opening pool balance for the income year; and
(b) the *taxable purpose proportion of the *adjustable value of
each *depreciating asset you started to use, or have *installed
ready for use, for a *taxable purpose during the income year
and that is allocated to the pool; and
(c) the taxable purpose proportion of any cost addition amounts
(see subsection 328-190(3)) for the income year for assets
allocated to the pool;

(3) In that case, the *closing pool balance of the pool for that income
year then becomes zero.
Example: Amanda’s Graphics is a small business entity for the 2014-15 income
year and chooses to use this Subdivision for that year. The business
has an opening pool balance of $8,500 for its general small business
pool for that year.
During that year, Amanda acquired a new computer for $2,000. The
taxable purpose proportion of its adjustable value is:
$2,000 x 80% business use estimate = $1,600
Amanda also sold her business car for $9,600 during that year. The car
was used 100% in the business.
To work out whether she can deduct an amount under this section,
Amanda uses this calculation:
$8,500 + $1,600 - $9,600 = $500
Because the result is less than $1,000, Amanda can deduct the $500
for the income year. The pool’s closing balance for the year is zero.

328-215 Disposal etc. of depreciating assets
(1) This section sets out adjustments you may have to make if a
*balancing adjustment event occurs for a *depreciating asset for
which you calculate your deductions under this Subdivision.
(2) If the asset is allocated to your *general small business pool and:
(a) the *closing pool balance of the pool for the income year in
which the event occurred is less than zero; or
(b) the amount worked out under subsection 328-210(2) for that
income year is less than zero;
the amount by which that balance or amount is less than zero is
included in your assessable income for that year.

year then becomes zero.

Note:

The reduction factor for a depreciating asset in your general small
business pool which you started to use, or have installed ready for use,
for a taxable purpose during an income year for which you were not a
small business entity or did not choose to use this Subdivision is:
•
0.7 for the income year after it is allocated to the pool; and
•
0.49 for the income year after that; and
•
0.343 for the income year after that.
The reduction factor for a depreciating asset in your general small

•
0.85 for the income year after it is allocated to the pool; and
•
0.595 for the income year after that; and
•
0.417 for the income year after that.

Exceptions
(5) However:
(a) you do not need to make an estimate or an adjustment under
this section for a *depreciating asset for an income year that
is at least 3 income years after the income year in which the
asset was allocated; and
(b) you cannot make an adjustment for a depreciating asset if
your reasonable estimate of the proportion you use a
depreciating asset, or have it *installed ready for use, for a

(1) Despite sections 85-10 and 86-60, if you are a *small business
entity for an income year you can deduct amounts for *depreciating
assets under this Subdivision.
(2) However, you cannot deduct an amount for a *car under this

chosen to use this Subdivision, sections 86-60 and 86-70 would
have prevented you deducting an amount for it.

Special rules about roll-overs
328-243 Roll-over relief
(1A) There is roll-over relief under subsection 40-340(1) (as affected by
subsection 40-340(2)) if:
(a) *balancing adjustment events occur for *depreciating assets
on a day (the BAE day) because an entity (the transferor)
disposes of the assets in an income year to another entity (the
transferee); and
(b) the disposal involves a *CGT event; and
(c) the conditions in item 1, 2, 3 or 8 of the table in
subsection 40-340(1) are satisfied; and
(d) deductions for the assets are calculated under this
Subdivision; and
(e) the transferor and the transferee jointly choose the roll-over
relief; and

equally between:
(a) the transferor and the transferee; or
(b) if there are 2 or more occurrences of balancing adjustment
events for relevant entities for the BAE year and a roll-over
is chosen for each occurrence—the entities concerned.
Example: John and Dave operate a dry cleaning business in partnership (the
transferor). The transferor is a small business entity for the relevant
income year and has chosen to use this Subdivision for that year. On
the 90th day of an income year, Jonathan joins the partnership. The
new partnership (the transferee) is a small business entity for the
income year and chooses to use this Subdivision for that year. Had
there been no partnership change, a deduction of $6,600 would have
been available for the transferor’s general small business pool. The
transferor and transferee jointly choose the roll-over.
The deduction available to the transferor and the transferee for the
pool under section 328-210 is $3,300 each.

(2) The transferor cannot deduct any amount for the transferor’s
*general small business pool for an income year after the BAE
year.

328-250 Deductions for assets first used in BAE year
(1) This section applies in working out the amount that the transferor
or transferee can deduct for the BAE year under
subsection 328-180(1) (assets costing less than $1,000) or
subsection 328-190(2) (assets that will be pooled) for a
*depreciating asset that the transferor or transferee started to use, or
have *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose during the
BAE year.
Note:

This threshold may be affected by section 328-180 (about temporary
increased access to accelerated depreciation) or 328-181 (about

Asset first used by transferor
(2) If the asset was first used or *installed ready for use by the
transferor, the amount that can be deducted under
subsection 328-180(1) or 328-190(2) for the asset for the BAE year
is split equally between:
(a) the transferor and the transferee; or
(b) if there are 2 or more occurrences of *balancing adjustment
events for relevant entities for the BAE year and a roll-over
is chosen for each occurrence—the entities concerned.
Asset first used by transferee
(3) If the asset was first used or *installed ready for use by the
transferee:
(a) the transferor cannot deduct anything for the asset for the
BAE year; and
(b) the amount that can be deducted under subsection 328-180(1)
or 328-190(2) for the asset for the BAE year is:
(i) deductible by the transferee; or
(ii) if there are 2 or more occurrences of *balancing
adjustment events for relevant entities for the BAE year
and a roll-over is chosen for each occurrence—split
equally between the entities concerned (except ones that
did not use the asset or have it installed ready for use).
Example: To continue the example from section 328-247, the transferee buys an
asset on the 150th day of the BAE year for $800.
On the 250th day of the year, Evan joins the transferee partnership.
The new transferee partnership is a small business entity for the BAE
year, and chooses to use this Subdivision for that year, and a further
roll-over is chosen.
The original transferor cannot deduct anything for the asset. The
original transferee (now a transferor) and the new transferee can
deduct $400 each.

328-357 Special meaning of small business entity for the purposes of
this Subdivision—$5 million turnover threshold
For the purposes of this Subdivision, in working out whether you
are a *small business entity for an income year, assume that each
reference in section 328-110 to $10 million were a reference to $5
million.

328-360 Amount of your tax offset
(1) The amount of your *tax offset is equal to 16% of the following:
Your total net small business income
for the income year
Your basic income tax

liability
for the income year
Your taxable income for the income year

where:
your total net small business income for the income year means
so much of the sum of the following as does not exceed your
taxable income for the income year:
(a) your *net small business income for the income year, if you
are a *small business entity for the income year;
(b) an amount referred to in paragraph 328-355(b) or (c) that is
included in your assessable income for the income year,
reduced (but not below zero) by your deductions to the extent
that they are attributable to that amount and covered by
section 328-370.
Note:

If you are under 18 years old, your total net small business income
will probably be worked out under section 328-375.

(2) However, the amount of your *tax offset is $1,000 if the amount
worked out under subsection (1) exceeds $1,000.
Note:

Your tax offset is capped at $1,000 regardless of the number of small
business entities that cause you to be entitled to the tax offset for the
income year.

328-435 Genuine restructures—safe harbour rule
For the purposes of paragraph 328-430(1)(a) (but without limiting
that paragraph), a transaction is, or is a part of, a genuine
restructure of an ongoing *business if, in the 3 year period after the
transaction takes effect:
(a) there is no change in ultimate economic ownership of any of
the significant assets of the business (other than *trading

have the effect of changing the ultimate economic ownership of an
asset, or any individual’s share of that ultimate economic
ownership, if:
(a) either or both of the following applies:
(i) just before the transaction took effect, the asset was
included in the property of a *non-fixed trust that was a
*family trust;
(ii) just after the transaction takes effect, the asset is
included in the property of a non-fixed trust that is a
family trust; and
(b) every individual who, just before the transfer took effect, had
the ultimate economic ownership of the asset was a member
of the family group (within the meaning of Schedule 2F to

trusts referred to in paragraph (a); and
(c) every individual who, just after the transfer takes effect, has
the ultimate economic ownership of the asset is a member of

For the purposes of paragraph 328-430(1)(e), the residency
requirement for an entity is that:
(a) if the entity is an individual or a company—the entity is an
Australian resident; or
(b) if the entity is a trust—it is a *resident trust for CGT
purposes; or
(c) if the entity is a partnership (other than a *corporate limited

Consequences of a roll-over under this Subdivision
328-450 Small business transfers not to affect income tax positions
(1) Except as provided by this Subdivision, a transfer of an asset has
no direct consequences under the *income tax law if:
(a) the transfer occurs under a transaction in relation to which
section 328-430 applies; and
(b) a roll-over under this Subdivision is available under that
section in relation to the asset.
Example: If the transfer were a transfer of the asset from a company to a
shareholder, it would not be treated as a payment of a dividend under
Division 7A of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.

(2) To avoid doubt, this section does not affect the application of the
*income tax law in relation to:
(a) anything that happens in relation to the asset that does not
directly relate to the transfer; or
(b) the ownership of the asset at any time.

assets
(1) The *income tax law applies to an entity in relation to the transfer
of an asset by the entity, or to the entity, as if the transfer takes
place for the asset’s *roll-over cost if:
(a) the transfer occurs under a transaction in relation to which
section 328-430 applies; and
(b) a roll-over under this Subdivision is available under that

(2) The asset’s roll-over cost is whichever of the following amounts is
applicable in relation to the transfer:
(a) in relation to the application of subsection (1) to the asset as a
*CGT asset (other than *trading stock, a *revenue asset or a
*depreciating asset)—the transferor’s *cost base for the asset
just before the transfer takes effect;
(b) in relation to the application of subsection (1) to the asset as
trading stock—the amount equal to:
(i) the *cost of the item for the transferor; or
(ii) if the transferor held the item as trading stock at the start
of the income year—the *value of the item for the
transferor then;
(c) in relation to the application of subsection (1) to the asset as a
revenue asset—the amount that would give rise to the
transferor not making a profit or a loss on the transfer.

328-460 Effect of small business restructures on acquisition times of
pre-CGT assets
For the purposes of applying subsection 328-455(1) to the asset as

(2) This object is to be achieved by providing a tax incentive for
industry to conduct, in a scientific way, experimental activities for
the purpose of generating new knowledge or information in either a
general or applied form (including new knowledge in the form of
new or improved materials, products, devices, processes or

(1) An *R&D entity cannot deduct expenditure under section 355-205
or 355-480 if:
(a) when it incurs the expenditure, the R&D entity or its
*associate had received, or could reasonably be expected to
receive, consideration:
(i) as a direct or indirect result of the expenditure being
incurred; and
(ii) regardless of the results of the activities on which the
expenditure is incurred; and
(b) that consideration is equal to or greater than the expenditure.

much of the expenditure as is equal to the consideration.
(3) For the purposes of paragraphs (1)(a) and (2)(a), have regard to:
(a) anything that happened or existed before or at the time the
expenditure is incurred; and
(b) anything that is likely to happen or exist after that time.

Reducing deductions by group mark-ups
(2) The amount the *R&D entity can deduct, apart from this section,
under section 355-205 or 355-480 for the income year is reduced
by the amount (the reduction amount) worked out as follows:
Method statement
Step 1.

Step 2.

For each grouped entity, work out the sum of the
amounts derived during the income year, or an earlier
income year, by the grouped entity for goods or services
relating to one or more of the *R&D activities while:
(a)

the grouped entity was *connected with the *R&D
entity; or

(b)

the grouped entity was an *affiliate of the R&D
entity or the R&D entity was an affiliate of the
grouped entity.

From the sum of those amounts, subtract the actual cost
to each grouped entity of providing the goods or services
that correspond to those amounts.

If R&D entity has deductions for both R&D expenditure and
earlier year associate R&D expenditure
(3) However, if the *R&D entity can deduct amounts under both
sections 355-205 and 355-480 for the income year, those amounts
are reduced as follows:
(a) apply the reduction amount to reduce the amount otherwise
deductible under section 355-205 (but not below zero); and
(b) then apply any remainder of the reduction amount to reduce
the amount otherwise deductible under section 355-480 (but

This Subdivision modifies the rules in this Division for partners of
R&D partnerships.
In particular, the rules about deducting R&D expenditure are
modified to allow a partner to deduct the partner’s proportion of
the R&D partnership’s expenditure on R&D activities.
A partner of an R&D partnership may also be able to deduct under
this Subdivision the decline in value of partnership assets used for
R&D activities.

355-505 Meaning of R&D partnership and partner’s proportion
(1) A partnership is an R&D partnership at a particular time if, at that
time, each of the partners is an *R&D entity.
(2) For an amount attributable to an *R&D partnership for an income
year, each partner of the R&D partnership is taken to bear or be
entitled to (as appropriate) this proportion (the partner’s
proportion) of the amount:
(a) the proportion the partners agreed the partner should bear or
be entitled to (as appropriate); or
(b) if there is no such agreement—the proportion of the partner’s
interest in the *net income or *partnership loss of the R&D
partnership for the income year.

(a) a *balancing adjustment event happens in an income year (the
event year) for an asset *held by an *R&D partnership; and
(b) the R&D partnership cannot deduct an amount under
section 40-25, as that section applies apart from:
(i) this Division; and
(ii) former section 73BC of the Income Tax Assessment Act
1936;
for the asset for an income year; and
(c) the partner is entitled under section 355-100 to *tax offsets
for one or more income years for deductions (the R&D
deductions) under section 355-520 for the asset; and
(d) the partner is registered under section 27A of the Industry
Research and Development Act 1986 for one or more *R&D
activities for the event year; and
(e) if Division 40 applied with the changes described in
section 355-310 (as affected by subsection 355-520(2)):
(i) the R&D partnership could deduct for the event year an
amount under subsection 40-285(2) for the asset and the
balancing adjustment event; or
(ii) an amount would be included in the R&D partnership’s
assessable income for the event year under
subsection 40-285(1) for the asset and the balancing

Section 360-25
(b) a total of more than $50,000 was paid for the issue to you of
the shares resulting from all of those offers.
(2) For the purposes of this section, assume that Chapter 6D of the
Corporations Act 2001 applies to those offers.

360-25 Amount of the tax offset—general case
(1) If subsection 360-15(1) applies, the amount of your *tax offset is
20% of the sum of the following:
(a) an amount equal to any money received, or entitled to be
received, by the company referred to in
paragraph 360-15(1)(b) for the issue to you of the *shares as
described in that paragraph;
(b) an amount equal to the *market value of any *non-cash
benefit received, or entitled to be received, by the company
referred to in paragraph 360-15(1)(b) for the issue to you of
the shares as described in that paragraph, as at the time the
shares were issued to you.
(2) However, reduce this amount to the extent necessary to ensure that
the sum of the following does not exceed $200,000:
(a) the sum of the *tax offsets under this Subdivision for the
income year for which you and your *affiliates (if any) are
entitled;
(b) the sum of the tax offsets under this Subdivision that you and
your affiliates (if any) carry forward to the income year.

360-30 Amount of the tax offset—members of trusts or partnerships
(1) If subsection 360-15(2) applies, the amount of the *member’s *tax
offset for the income year is as follows:

Section 360-30
notional tax offset amount is what would, under section 360-25,
have been the amount of the trust’s or partnership’s *tax offset (the
notional tax offset) if the trust or partnership had been an
individual.
(1A) However, reduce the amount worked out under subsection (1) to
the extent necessary to ensure that the sum of the following does
not exceed $200,000:
(a) the sum of the *tax offsets under this Subdivision for the
income year for which the member and the member’s
*affiliates (if any) are entitled;
(b) the sum of the tax offsets under this Subdivision that the
member and the member’s affiliates (if any) carry forward to
the income year.
(2) The trustee or partnership may determine the percentage of the
notional tax offset that is the *member’s share of the notional tax
offset.
(3) If, under the terms and conditions under which the trust or
partnership operates, the *member would be entitled to a fixed
proportion of any *capital gain from a *disposal:
(a) relating to the trust or partnership; and
(b) of the *shares that gave rise to the notional tax offset; and
(c) happening at the end of the income year to which the
notional tax offset relates;
the percentage determined under subsection (2) must be equivalent
to that fixed proportion, and a determination of any other
percentage has no effect.
(4) The trustee or partnership must give the *member written notice of
the determination. The notice:
(a) must enable the member to work out the amount of the
member’s *tax offset by including enough information to
enable the member to work out the member’s share of the
notional tax offset; and

the income year, or within such further time as the
Commissioner allows.
(5) The sum of all the percentages determined under subsection (2) in
relation to the *members of the trust or partnership must not exceed
100%.

360-35 Amount of the tax offset—trustees
If subsection 360-15(3) applies, the amount of the *tax offset is the
difference between:
(a) what would, under section 360-25, have been the amount of
the tax offset to which the trustee would have been entitled if
the trustee had been an individual; and
(b) if *members of the trust are entitled to tax offsets under
subsection 360-15(2) arising from the same *shares to which
the trustee’s entitlement arises under subsection 360-15(3)—
the sum of the amounts worked out under section 360-30
(disregarding any reductions under subsection 360-30(1A))
for those tax offsets.

360-40 Early stage innovation companies

(1) The purpose of this section is to ensure that the modifications made
by section 360-50 are not affected merely because of one or more
*same-asset roll-overs or *replacement-asset roll-overs (other than
roll-overs under Division 122 or Subdivision 124-M).
(2) If, apart from those roll-overs, the entity (the original entity)
mentioned in subsection 360-50(1) would continue to hold the
*share (the original share) mentioned in that subsection, then
subsections 360-50(2) to (5) apply as if:
(a) the following asset were the original share:
(i) if the last roll-over is a *same-asset roll-over—the asset
for the roll-over;

Note:

The asset for subparagraph (i) will be the original share unless a
replacement-asset roll-over happened beforehand.

(b) that asset was issued when the original share was issued; and
(c) the entity that *acquired that asset for the roll-over had
continuously held that asset since the original share was
issued; and
(d) that entity were the original entity; and
(e) in a case where that entity is a partnership—paragraphs (a) to
(d) modify subsections 360-50(2) to (5) as they apply with
the modifications in section 360-55; and
(f) in a case where that entity is not a partnership but the entity
that owned the original asset for the roll-over is—
paragraphs (a) to (d) modify subsections 360-50(2) to (5) as
they apply without the modifications in section 360-55.

(c) a refundable tax offset for Australian expenditure on post,
digital and visual effects production for any film (the PDV
offset).
(2) A company is only entitled to one of these offsets in relation to a
film.
(3) The amount of the offset is determined as a percentage of certain
Australian expenditure incurred by a company in producing the
film:
(a) the amount of the producer offset is:
(i) if the film is a feature film that was produced for
commercial exhibition to the public in cinemas—40%
of the company’s qualifying Australian production
expenditure on the film; and
(ii) otherwise—30% of the company’s qualifying
Australian production expenditure on the film; and
(b) the amount of the location offset is 30% of the company’s
qualifying Australian production expenditure on the film; and
(c) the amount of the PDV offset is 30% of the company’s
qualifying Australian production expenditure on the film that
relates to post, digital and visual effects production for the
film.
(4) One of the requirements for entitlement to these offsets is that a
company must be issued with a certificate for the film. The
certificate will state the amount of Australian expenditure on which
the offset will be determined.
(5) The offset is claimed by a company in its income tax return.

(1) Subdivision 376-B tells you about the different tax offsets
available for films, who can get each offset and what conditions
must be met to get each offset. It also tells you how to work out the

(a) may be expenditure that is incurred in the income year for
which the *tax offset is sought or in an earlier income year;
and
(b) may be expenditure of either a capital or a revenue nature;
and
(c) may be expenditure that gives rise to a deduction.
Paragraph (c) has effect subject to item 10 of the table in
section 376-135 (which deals with capital allowances).
(6) If:
(a) a company:
(i) *holds a *depreciating asset; and
(ii) uses the asset, while held, in the *making of a *film; and
(b) deductions in relation to the asset are available under
Division 40 (which deals with capital allowances);
the production expenditure of the company on the film includes an
amount equal to the decline in the value of the asset to the extent to
which that decline is reasonably attributable to the use of the asset
in the making of the film (the film proportion). The decline in
value of the asset is to be worked out using Division 40.
Note:

Under item 10 of the table in section 376-135, expenditure that sets or
increases the cost of the asset does not count as production
expenditure.

(7) If a *balancing adjustment event occurs for the asset before the film
is *completed:
(a) if the asset’s *termination value is more than its *adjustable
value just before the event occurred—the production
expenditure of the company on the film is reduced by the
film proportion of the difference; or
(b) if the asset’s termination value is less than its adjustable
value just before the event occurred—the production
expenditure of the company on the film includes the film
proportion of the difference.

378-1 What this Division is about
Companies may be entitled to a refundable tax offset in relation to
qualifying Australian development expenditure incurred in
completing or porting a digital game, or carrying on ongoing
development of digital games in an income year.
This offset is designed to support the growth of the digital games
industry in Australia by providing concessional tax treatment for
Australian expenditure.
One of the requirements for entitlement to the digital games tax
offset is that the company must be issued with a certificate in
respect of the completion, porting or ongoing development of a
digital game. The certificate specifies the amount of qualifying
Australian development expenditure determined by the Arts
Minister in respect of the completion, porting or ongoing
development of the digital game.

Section 378-20
amounts determined by the Arts Minister under
section 378-25 that are specified in certificates issued to the
related company for the income year under section 378-30;
and
(c) the sum of all the amounts specified in the notices given by
the company and those related companies does not exceed
$20,000,000.
Example: Bilby Co is primarily responsible for developing a digital game.
Wombat Co, a company connected with Bilby Co, is also primarily
responsible for developing a digital game. The amount worked out
under subsection (1) is $15,000,000 for the income year for each
company. Since the sum of these amounts exceeds $20,000,000, the
companies must coordinate with one another to ensure that the amount
collectively claimed stays under the $20,000,000 cap. Bilby Co and
Wombat Co agree that for the income year, they will each give the
Commissioner a notice specifying $10,000,000 in notices. If they both
do so, each will receive an offset of $10,000,000 for the income year.

(4) A notice given under subsection (3) by a company in relation to an
income year must be given at the same time as the company claims
the digital games *tax offset in its *income tax return for the
income year.
(5) A company may vary the amount specified in a notice given under
subsection (3) in relation to an income year if:
(a) in specifying the amount in the notice:
(i) the company made an inadvertent error in determining
whether another company is a related company; and
(ii) as a result the company did not take account of the
amount of the digital games tax offset for the other
company for the income year; and
(b) the company gives the Commissioner a notice in the
*approved form specifying the varied amount.
Otherwise, the notice is irrevocable.

Example 2: An interactive corporate training program would fail to satisfy the
condition that the digital game must not be primarily developed for
corporate purposes.

(c) if the certificate is to be issued under subsection 378-25(5)
(ongoing development certificate) to the company for an
income year in relation to one or more digital games—the
total of the company’s qualifying Australian development
expenditure on the games incurred in the income year on the

stock
Your assessable income includes an amount for replacement live stock you
breed
Purchase price of replacement live stock is reduced

385-95 Basic principles for elections under this Subdivision
(1) You can elect:
• to spread the profit on the disposal or death over the

income year of the disposal or death and the next 4 income
years (election to spread); or
• to defer including the profit in your assessable income, if

you will use the proceeds of the disposal or death mainly to
replace the live stock (election to defer).
(2) If you make an election to defer, the profit is “used” over the next
5 income years:
• by reducing the amount for which you are taken to have

bought replacement stock (as a result, your tax profit on
the disposal of the replacement stock is increased); and
• by including in your assessable income amounts for

replacement stock that you breed.
Any unused part of the profit is included in your assessable income
for the fifth income year.

385-120 Purchase price of replacement live stock is reduced
(1) If you make the election in section 385-110, then the amount paid
or payable for the purchase of each replacement animal you buy in
the *disposal year, or in the next 5 income years, is treated as if it
were reduced by the *reduction amount.
Meaning of reduction amount
(2) The reduction amount is:
• so much of the *tax profit on the disposal or death as is
attributable to live stock of the species you are replacing;
divided by:
• the number of animals of that species that you disposed of or
that died.
(3) However, if:
(a) you purchase a replacement animal of a different species
from the *live stock it replaces; and
(b) you pay substantially more for it than you could have paid
for a replacement animal of the same species;
the reduction amount for the animal is any reasonable amount at
least equal to the amount worked out under subsection (2).
Exception to avoid reducing unused tax profit to less than nil
(4) However, if applying subsection (1) to a particular purchase would
reduce the *unused tax profit on the disposal or death to less than
nil, instead reduce the amount paid or payable for the purchase of
each replacement animal in that purchase by:
• the *unused tax profit on the disposal or death;

divided by:
• the number of animals in the purchase.

If you are a primary producer for 2 or more years in a row, this

does so by reducing the effect that fluctuations in your taxable
income have on the marginal rates of tax that apply to you from
year to year.)

How averaging adjustments work
(1) This Division reduces or increases your income tax liability to
bring it closer to what it would have been if worked out using a
special rate of income tax. That rate (the comparison rate) is based
on the income tax that you would pay for the current year on the
average of your taxable income for up to the last 5 income years.

Effect of non-primary production income on averaging adjustment
(5) Your income from sources other than your primary production
business may affect the adjustment of your income tax. If more
than $5,000 of your basic taxable income is attributable to those
sources, your averaging adjustment will be reduced to reflect the
proportion of your basic taxable income attributable to primary
production. (There are special shading-out arrangements if your
taxable income from other sources is between $5,000 and
$10,000.)

392-10 Individuals who carry on a primary production business
(1) This Division applies to your assessment for the *current year if:
(a) you are an individual; and
(b) you have carried on a *primary production business in
Australia for 2 or more income years in a row (the last of
which is the current year); and
(c) for at least one of those income years your *basic taxable
income is less than or equal to your basic taxable income for
the next of those income years.
Note 1:

It follows that this Division does not apply if your basic taxable
income has decreased every income year since you started carrying on
a primary production business.

Note 2:

In working out whether this Division applies to your assessment for an
income year, you may need to take account of income years before the
1998-99 income year: see section 392-1 of the Income Tax
(Transitional Provisions) Act 1997.

Continued application of this Division after you stop carrying on a
primary production business

How to work out the comparison rate
392-40 Identify income years for averaging your basic taxable
income
The income years over which you must average your *basic taxable
income are:
(a) if this Division has applied to your assessment for at least 4
income years in a row (including the *current year)—the
current year and the 4 previous income years; or
(b) if this Division has applied to your assessment for less than 4
income years in a row (including the *current year)—those
income years and the last income year before them.
Note:

You may need to average your basic taxable income for one or more
income years before the 1998-99 income year. See section 392-1 of
the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997.

392-45 Work out your average income for those years

Step 3.

Round the result down to the nearest whole dollar if the
result is not already a number of whole dollars.

(2) Your basic assessable income for an income year is your

392-65 What your averaging adjustment reflects
(1) Your averaging adjustment is a proportion of your gross averaging
amount, taking account of:
(a) your taxable primary production income (the part of your
basic taxable income from your primary production
business); and
(b) your taxable non-primary production income (the part of
your basic taxable income from other sources).
Your averaging component is the means of taking into account the
different parts of your basic taxable income in working out your
averaging adjustment.
(2) If your taxable non-primary production income is less than or equal
to $5,000, your averaging component equals the whole of your
basic taxable income. (In other words, your averaging component
includes all of your taxable primary production income and all of
your taxable non-primary production income.)
(3) If your taxable non-primary production income is between $5,000
and $10,000, a shading-out system applies so that your averaging
component includes some of your taxable non-primary production
income as well as all of your taxable primary production income.
(4) If your taxable non-primary production income is $10,000 or more,
your averaging component equals your taxable primary production
income. Your averaging component does not include any of your
taxable non-primary production income.
(5) The following diagram shows examples of these relationships.

Choosing to discontinue and restart averaging
(1) You can choose that this Division not affect your *income tax

writing by the day you lodge your *income tax return for the

it later.

Working out the extent of the permanent reduction
(2) In working out the extent of the permanent reduction, you must

assessable income from sources from which you do not usually

393-1 What this Division is about
You can deduct a farm management deposit you make, if:
(a) you are an individual carrying on a primary production
business (including a primary production business you
carry on as a partner in a partnership or as a beneficiary
of a trust); and
(b) you hold the deposit for at least 12 months; and
(c) you meet some other tests.
The amount of the deposit withdrawn is included in your
assessable income in the income year in which it is repaid. Special
rules apply if the deposit is repaid in the event of a severe drought
or an applicable natural disaster.
Farm management deposits allow you to carry over income from
years of good cash flow and to draw down on that income in years
when you need the cash. This enables you to defer the income tax
on your taxable primary production income from the income year
in which you make the deposit until the income year in which the
deposit is repaid.

Note 2:

This Division applies to certain partners and beneficiaries as if they
were individuals who carried on a primary production business: see
subsections 393-25(2), (3), (4), (5) and (6).

Sum of deductions not to exceed taxable primary production
income
(2) The sum of the deductions that you would otherwise be entitled to
under this section for *farm management deposits made in the
income year must not exceed your *taxable primary production
income for the income year.
Amounts to be deducted in order of deposits
(3) If you are entitled to deduct amounts in respect of 2 or more
deposits, deduct the amounts in the order in which the deposits
were made (until you reach the limit imposed by subsection (2)).

393-10 Assessability on repayment of deposit
Amount assessable
(1) Your assessable income for an income year includes the amount
worked out using the following formula, if:
(a) you are the *owner of a *farm management deposit; and
(b) the deposit is repaid in full or in part in the year; and
(c) the amount worked out using the formula is greater than nil:
*Unrecouped

FMD deduction in
respect of the deposit
just before the repayment

Amount (if any) of

just after the repayment

Note 1:

This subsection does not apply if the deposit is reinvested, the term of
the deposit is extended, or the deposit is transferred at the depositor’s
request: see sections 393-15 and 393-16.

Note 2:

In a case where not all of the deposit is deductible under
section 393-5, repayment of the non-deductible amount can take place
without the amount being assessable. Once that amount is repaid, the
remainder is assessable when it is repaid, so that the deduction is
recouped.

Division 393 Farm management deposits

Section 393-10
Example: Matt makes a farm management deposit of $120,000 on 1 April 2011.
His taxable primary production income for the 2010—11 income year
is $50,000; therefore, the deposit is only partly deductible in the year
because it exceeds his taxable primary production income. Matt makes
the following withdrawals from the deposit: $45,000 on 1 May 2013,
$40,000 on 1 March 2014 and $35,000 on 1 September 2015.
The unrecouped FMD deduction immediately before the first
repayment of $45,000 is $50,000. No amount is included in his
assessable income for the 2012-2013 income year because the
difference between the unrecouped FMD deduction ($50,000) and the
amount of the deposit remaining after the repayment ($75,000) is less
than nil.
The unrecouped FMD deduction immediately before the second
repayment of $40,000 is $50,000. $15,000 is included in Matt’s
assessable income for the 2013-2014 income year because the
difference between the unrecouped FMD deduction ($50,000) and the
amount of the deposit remaining after the second repayment ($35,000)
is $15,000, which is greater than nil.
The unrecouped FMD deduction immediately before the third
repayment of $35,000 is $35,000; that is, $50,000 less $15,000.
$35,000 is included in Matt’s assessable income for the 2015-2016
income year; that is, the difference between the unrecouped FMD
deduction ($35,000) and the amount of the deposit remaining after the
third repayment ($0).

Unrecouped FMD deduction
(2) The unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of a *farm
management deposit at a particular time is:
(a) if no part of the deposit has been repaid before that time—the
amount of the deduction under section 393-5 for making the
deposit; or
(b) if one or more parts of the deposit have been repaid before
that time—the unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the
deposit just before the most recent such repayment, reduced
by any amount included in the *owner’s assessable income
under this section as a result of that repayment.
Example: Mia makes a deposit of $3,000, all of which is deductible. The
deposit’s unrecouped FMD deduction just before a first repayment of
$1,000 is the amount of the deduction (that is, $3,000—see
paragraph (2)(a)). The deposit’s unrecouped FMD deduction just

before a second repayment is $2,000 (that is, according to
paragraph (2)(b), the unrecouped FMD deduction immediately before
the first repayment ($3,000) reduced by the $1,000 included in Mia’s
assessable income as a result of the first repayment).
Note 1:

If the deposit was originally an income equalisation deposit, see
section 393-10 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997.

Note 1A:

Subsection 393-16(3) affects the unrecouped FMD deduction of a
consolidated farm management deposit.

Note 2:

Section 393-55 affects the unrecouped FMD deduction of a new
deposit linked to an old deposit affected by Division 2AA (Financial
claims scheme for account-holders with insolvent ADIs) of Part II of
the Banking Act 1959.

Application of Division to transfer, reinvestment or other dealing
(3) This Division applies to a transfer, reinvestment or other dealing
with a *farm management deposit as if it were a repayment of the
deposit, if:
(a) you are the depositor; and
(b) the transfer, reinvestment or other dealing is on your behalf
or at your request.
Note:

Section 393-15 modifies the application of the deduction, assessment
and 12 month rules to certain transfers, reinvestments and other
dealings.

Deemed repayment because of death, bankruptcy etc.
(4) This section applies as if a *farm management deposit had been
repaid when it became repayable, rather than when it is actually
repaid, if the deposit became repayable because of the requirement
contained in the relevant agreement as set out in item 11 of the
table in section 393-35 (death, bankruptcy etc.).
Note 1:

This means that the amount of the deposit is included in your
assessable income for the income year when the death, bankruptcy etc.
occurs, rather than for any later year in which the deposit might be
repaid.

Note 2:

This also means that, under subsection 45-120(5) in Schedule 1 to the
Taxation Administration Act 1953 (about Pay as you go (PAYG)

However, under section 12-140 in that Schedule, an amount may also
be required to be withheld from the actual payment if you do not
quote your tax file number or ABN to the relevant FMD provider.
Note 3:

Section 393-60 of this Act may limit the operation of subsection (4) if
the farm management deposit is with an ADI that becomes a declared
ADI under Division 2AA (Financial claims scheme for
account-holders with insolvent ADIs) of Part II of the Banking Act
1959.

393-15 Transactions to which the deduction, assessment and 12
month rules have modified application
(1) The provisions mentioned in subsection (2) do not apply in relation
to the following transactions:
(a) the immediate reinvestment of a *farm management deposit
as a farm management deposit with the same *FMD provider;
(b) the extension of the term of a farm management deposit
(even if other terms such as those relating to interest payable
are also varied);
(c) the transfer of a farm management deposit in accordance
with a requirement of the relevant agreement as set out in
item 13 of the table in section 393-35 (which allows for
transfers of deposits at the request of the depositor).
Note:

This means that these transactions:
(a) will not result in assessable income for the owner; and
(b) will not give rise to a deduction; and
(c) will not, if the transaction occurs within 12 months after the end
of the day the deposit is made, result in the deposit losing its
status as a farm management deposit.

(2) The provisions are:

management deposit); and
(b) subsection 393-10(1) (about assessability of the repayment of
a farm management deposit); and

(d) subsections 393-40(3A) and (4) (about repayment of a farm
management deposit in the event of an applicable natural
disaster).
(3) For the purposes of working out the *unrecouped FMD deduction
for a deposit that is subject to a transaction mentioned in
subsection (1), the transaction does not cause the deposit to be a
different deposit.
Note:

This ensures that the unrecouped FMD deduction (which affects how
much income tax is assessed in the event of a repayment) equals the
deduction for the original deposit, less any amount included in your
assessable income because of a previous repayment of the deposit.

393-16 Consolidation of farm management deposits
(1) The provisions mentioned in subsection (2) do not apply in relation
to the immediate reinvestment of 2 or more *farm management
deposits (original deposits) if:
(a) just before the reinvestment occurs the balance of each of the
original deposits is equal to the *unrecouped FMD deduction
for the deposit; and
(b) the original deposits are immediately reinvested as a single
farm management deposit with the same *FMD provider, or
with a different FMD provider; and
(c) just before the reinvestment occurs the original deposits have
each been held for a period of at least 12 months.
Note:

This means that the reinvestment:
(a) will not result in assessable income for the owner; and
(b) will not give rise to a deduction.

management deposits
(1) To avoid doubt, if amounts of interest payable by the *owner of a
*farm management deposit, or by a partnership of which the owner
is a partner, to the *FMD provider in respect of loans or other debts
of the owner or partnership fall short of what they otherwise would
be because the owner holds the farm management deposit, then:
(a) any income of the owner or partnership comprising the
shortfall is neither assessable income nor *exempt income of
the owner or partnership; and
(b) any amount that any person:
(i) is not liable to pay because of the shortfall; and
(ii) could have, apart from this section, deducted under this
Act;
is not deductible.
(2) However, this section applies only to the extent that the loans or
other debts relate to a *primary production business that the *owner
or partnership carries on.

Operative provisions
393-55 Farm management deposits arising from farm management
deposits with ADIs subject to financial claims scheme
Application
(1) This section applies if an entitlement arises under Division 2AA
(Financial claims scheme for account-holders with insolvent ADIs)
of Part II of the Banking Act 1959 in connection with an account
containing a *farm management deposit (the old deposit) with an
*ADI (the old ADI) and either:
(a) an amount (the new deposit) is deposited into either of the
following to meet, in whole or part, so much of the
entitlement as relates to the old deposit:
(i) an existing account for a farm management deposit;
(ii) an account established under section 16AH of that Act
for the purposes of meeting (in whole or part) the
entitlement; or
(b) an amount (also the new deposit) is deposited by a liquidator
of the old ADI into either of the following as so much of a
distribution from the liquidation of the old ADI as relates to
the old deposit:
(i) an existing account for a farm management deposit;
(ii) an account established under section 16AR of that Act
for the payment of the distribution.
Note:

If an amount is deposited in connection with an account with the old
ADI containing 2 or more old deposits, the amount is to be
apportioned between each old deposit, so that so much of the amount
as is attributable to a particular old deposit is regarded as a distinct
new deposit relating to that old deposit.

New deposit is a farm management deposit
(2) This Division (except this section) applies to the new deposit as if
the new deposit were a transfer of the old deposit in accordance
with a requirement contained in the relevant agreement for the old

deposit as set out in item 13 of the table in section 393-35 (which
allows for transfers of deposits at the request of the depositor). To
avoid doubt, this Division applies in that way as if the amount
transferred were the amount of the new deposit, even if that is
more or less than the amount of the old deposit.
Note 1:

The effects of this include the following:
(a) section 393-5 (about deductions for making a farm management
deposit) does not apply in relation to the making of the new
deposit (see paragraphs 393-15(1)(c) and (2)(a));
(b) subsection 393-10(1) (about assessability of the repayment of a
farm management deposit) can only apply to the extent of any
difference between the amount transferred and the amount of the
old deposit (see paragraphs 393-15(1)(c) and (2)(b));
(c) subsections 393-40(1), (2) and (4) (about repayment of a farm
management deposit within the first 12 months) can only apply
to the extent of any difference between the amount transferred
and the amount of the old deposit (see paragraphs 393-15(1)(c)
and (2)(c) and (d));
(d) the day the old deposit was made, for the purposes of
subsections 393-40(1) and (2) (about repayment of a farm
management deposit within the first 12 months) and (3A) and (4)
(about repayment in the event of an applicable natural disaster),
is maintained for the new deposit (see subsection 393-40(6)).

Note 2:

Also, the unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the new deposit is
the same as the unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the old
deposit (see subsection 393-15(3)), unless subsection (6) or (7) of this
section applies because the new deposit is less than the old deposit.

(3) In determining whether either of the following is a *farm
management deposit, disregard a requirement contained in an
agreement as set out in item 4 of the table in section 393-35
(requiring the deposit to be $1,000 or more):
(a) the new deposit;
(b) a deposit made later directly by the transfer of the new
deposit in accordance with a requirement of the relevant
agreement for the new deposit as mentioned in item 13 of
that table.

Section 393-60
Unrecouped FMD deduction for new deposit less than old deposit
(6) Despite subsection (2) and subsection 393-15(3), if the new deposit
is less than the old deposit at the time (the declaration time) the
old ADI became a declared ADI under the Banking Act 1959, the
unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the new deposit is the
amount worked out using the following formula:
Unrecouped FMD deduction
in respect of old deposit

just before declaration time
Note:

New deposit
Old deposit just
before declaration time

The new deposit could be less than the old deposit if the entitlement is
paid in instalments (each of which will be a separate new deposit).

(7) However, if the amount worked out under subsection (6) is more
than the difference (if any) between:
(a) the *unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the old deposit
just before the declaration time; and
(b) the total of the amounts worked out under all previous
applications of subsection (6) in relation to that old deposit;
the unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the new deposit is
equal to the difference (if any).
Note:

This ensures that when new deposits linked to the old deposit are
repaid, the total amount included in assessable income will not exceed
the unrecouped FMD deduction in respect of the old deposit.

Relationship with other provisions
(8) This section has effect despite Division 253 (about tax treatment of
entitlements under the financial claims scheme for insolvent
ADIs).

Significant fluctuations can occur in the professional incomes of
authors, inventors, performing artists, production associates and
sportspersons.
To lessen the impact of these fluctuations on your marginal tax
rates, special tax rates apply if your professional income is above
your average.
This Division explains how the scheme works and sets out the
rules for working out your above-average special professional

405-5 Special rate of income tax on your above-average special
professional income
(1) If you have above-average special professional income, the Income
Tax Rates Act 1986 generally sets a special rate so that the amount
of income tax you pay on the top 4/5 of your above-average special
professional income is effectively 4 times what you would pay on
the bottom 1/5 of that income at basic rates.
Note :

Your overall income tax will be less only if 2 marginal rates of
income tax would apply to your above-average special professional
income if it were treated as the top slice of your taxable income.

(2) The following diagram illustrates how the special rate works.

415-10 What this Subdivision is about
The unutilised amounts of a designated infrastructure project
entity’s tax losses are increased each year by the long term bond
rate. A designated infrastructure project entity is a fixed trust or
company that:
(a) carries on an infrastructure project designated under
Subdivision 415-C; and
(b) only engages, and has only ever engaged, in activities
for the purposes of carrying on that designated
infrastructure project.
The tests that apply in relation to tax losses and bad debts if there is
a change of ownership of an entity are modified so that periods
during which the entity is a designated infrastructure project entity
are not tested.
The loss utilisation rules in Subdivision 707-C do not apply if the
head company of a consolidated group is a designated
infrastructure project entity after another designated infrastructure
project entity joins the group.
Note:
The transfer rules in subsection 707-120(1A) do not apply
if a designated infrastructure project entity joins a consolidated group:
see subsection 707-120(5).

(c) the 28th day after the day the *Infrastructure CEO designates
the infrastructure project under section 415-70;
(d) a later day allowed by the Commissioner.
Note:

The increase under this section can occur at the end of an income year

CEO has not yet designated the infrastructure project that the entity
carries on, but the Infrastructure CEO does so later).

tax treatment to the tax treatment previously applying in relation to
those activities.

417-10 Meaning of transitioned petroleum activities
(1) Transitioned petroleum activities are petroleum activities (within
the meaning of the *Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) that
are undertaken:
(a) pursuant to the terms of any of the following *production
sharing contracts:
(i) Production Sharing Contract JPDA 03-12;
(ii) Production Sharing Contract JPDA 03-13;
(iii) Production Sharing Contract JPDA 06-105;
(iv) Production Sharing Contract JPDA 11-106; or
(b) pursuant to the terms of a production sharing contract that:
(i) comes into force after, or when, that treaty entered into
force; and
(ii) has the effect of replacing, and relates to the same area
as, a production sharing contract mentioned in
paragraph (a); or
(c) in a part of the *Petroleum Exploration Permit WA-523-P
permit area that, as a result of that treaty entering into force,
ceased to be within the continental shelf of Australia.
Note:

This part of the Petroleum Exploration Permit WA-523-P permit area
includes the Buffalo Oil Field.

(2) The Petroleum Exploration Permit WA-523-P permit area is the
area that, just before the *Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty
entered into force, was the subject of Petroleum Exploration Permit

417-25 Deducting amounts for depreciating assets
(1) If:
(a) you use a *depreciating asset, or you have it *installed ready
for use, for a purpose of undertaking *transitioned petroleum
activities; and
(b) before the *Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty entered
into force, you or another entity used the asset, or you or
another entity had it installed ready for use, for a purpose of
undertaking transitioned petroleum activities;
to the extent that you use the asset, or you have it installed ready
for use, for that purpose, you are taken to use the asset, or to have it
installed ready for use, entirely for a *taxable purpose.
(2) For the purposes of subsection 40-25(2), if:
(a) you can deduct an amount for a decline in value of the asset;
and
(b) apart from subsection (1), you would not be able to deduct an
amount, or would only be able to deduct a lesser amount, for
that decline in value; and
(c) the *transitioned petroleum activities are wholly or partly
undertaken, or to be undertaken, in relation to the *JPDA;
to the extent that the activities are so undertaken, or so to be
undertaken, the part of the asset’s decline in value that is
attributable to your use of the asset, or your having it *installed
ready for use, for a *taxable purpose is reduced to 10% of what it
would be apart from this subsection.
(3) For the purposes of Subdivision 40-C, if:
(a) you can deduct an amount for a decline in value of the asset;

Section 417-30
(b) apart from subsection (1), you would not be able to deduct an
amount, or would only be able to deduct a lesser amount, for
that decline in value;
in working out the second element of the *cost of the asset,
disregard any amount that you pay, and any expenditure that you
incur, on or after the day on which the *Timor Sea Maritime
Boundaries Treaty entered into force.

417-30 Balancing adjustments
(1) If:
(a) before the *Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty entered
into force, you *held a *depreciating asset that you used, or
had *installed ready for use, for a purpose of undertaking
*transitioned petroleum activities; and
(b) you stopped holding the asset when that treaty entered into
force, because the asset ceased to exist at that time; and
(c) the cessation occurred in connection with the entry into force
of that treaty;
the cessation is taken, for the purposes of this Act, not to be a
*balancing adjustment event.
(2) Section 40-285 does not apply in relation to a *depreciating asset
you *held if:
(a) before the *Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty entered
into force, you or another entity used the asset, or you or
another entity had it *installed ready for use, for a purpose of
undertaking *transitioned petroleum activities; and
(b) on or after the day on which that treaty entered into force, a
*balancing adjustment event occurs for the asset.
Note:

The effect of this subsection is to prevent an amount being included in
your assessable income, or a deduction arising, because of a balancing
adjustment event. The balancing adjustment event still occurs, so the
operation of a section such as section 118-24 is unaffected.

asset is also used, or *installed ready for use, for a purpose other
than the purpose of undertaking *transitioned petroleum activities.
(4) If, as a result of the *balancing adjustment event mentioned in
paragraph (2)(b), another entity *holds the asset, the *cost of the
asset to the other entity is taken to be the asset’s *adjustable value
to you just before the balancing adjustment event occurs.

417-35 Allocating assets to a project pool
(1) You may choose to allocate to a project pool all the *depreciating
assets (the pooled assets) that:

section 417-30:
(a) the pooled assets are taken to be a single *depreciating asset
that you *hold; and
(b) the single asset is taken to be used, or *installed ready for
use, for the same purpose as the purpose for which the pooled
assets were used, or installed ready for use, when the *Timor
Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty entered into force; and
(c) the *cost of the single asset is taken to be an amount equal to
the sum of the *adjustable values of all of the pooled assets
when that treaty entered into force; and
(d) the decline in value of the single asset is taken to be:
(i) for the initial income year—40% of its cost; and

(5) The transfer of a pooled asset to another entity does not affect the
operation of subsection (4) in relation to the single asset.

417-40 Deduction for expenditure on mining site rehabilitation

section:
(a) acquiring land or an interest in land or a right, power or
privilege to do with land;

to have incurred the tax loss to the extent of the amount.
(2) Despite paragraph (1)(a), if the loss year is the same as the income
year of the transfer, the transferee is taken to have incurred the *tax
loss in the income year before the loss year.
Note:

This rule is needed because Division 36 allows a tax loss to be
deducted only if it was incurred in an earlier income year.

(3) The amount of the *franking credit under paragraph (1)(c) is an
amount equal to the amount of the *tax loss transferred multiplied
by the standard corporate tax rate (within the meaning of Part IVA
of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936).
(4) Paragraph (1)(c) does not apply if you are not, and have never
been, a *corporate tax entity.

417-105 The effect of choosing to apply losses to earlier income years
If you choose under this Subdivision to apply an amount of a *tax
loss for an income year as a deduction from your assessable
income for an earlier income year:
(a) you can deduct the amount from your assessable income for
the earlier income year; and
(b) you can no longer *utilise the amount, and you are taken not
to have incurred the tax loss to the extent of the amount.

417-110 Continuity of ownership and business continuity tests
Section 165-10 does not apply to a *tax loss that meets the
requirements of:
(a) paragraphs 417-90(1)(a) and (b); or
(b) paragraphs 417-90(2)(a) and (b).

418-1 What this Division is about
Generally, you are entitled to a tax offset for an income year for
exploration credits issued to you for the income year.
A greenfields minerals explorer can create exploration credits for
an income year. Before creating exploration credits, the explorer
must obtain an allocation of exploration credits from the
Commissioner for the year. Exploration credits cannot be created
for the 2025-26 income year or later income years.

Section 418-1
The exploration credits created for an income year cannot exceed
an amount based on the explorer’s greenfields minerals
expenditure or tax loss for the year. If the explorer’s exploration
credits allocation for the year is smaller than that amount, the
amount of exploration credits that the explorer can create will be
reduced to sit within the allocation. However, any unused
allocation of exploration credits from the preceding year generally
would be carried over and so would increase the amount of
exploration credits that the explorer can create.
An exploration credit created by a greenfields minerals explorer
can be issued to you if you have invested in the explorer. While the
tax offset you receive for the exploration credit issued to you for an
income year will apply to that income year generally, the
investment that gives rise to that offset may have been made in that
or the preceding income year.
There are rules to ensure that exploration credits are not streamed
to some investors rather than others. There are also rules to ensure
that the total of the exploration credits you receive because of an
investment (whether those credits are issued to you for the year in
which you invest or the subsequent year) do not exceed the
corporate tax that might be paid by the greenfields minerals
explorer on that investment.
The explorer is liable to pay excess exploration credit tax if the
explorer issues exploration credits in breach of these rules.
There is a cap on total allocations made by the Commissioner for
each income year, but if part of the cap from the preceding year is
unallocated it generally will be carried over. Allocations are made
in the order in which applications for an allocation are made.
If an exploration credit is issued to a corporate tax entity, it will
give rise to a franking credit (rather than a tax offset).
Note:

Excess exploration credit tax is imposed by the Excess Exploration
Credit Tax Act 2015, and the amount of the tax is set out in that Act.

Section 418-150
418-150 Excess exploration credit tax
An entity is liable to pay *excess exploration credit tax for an
income year if the sum of the *exploration credits it issues for the
income year exceeds the amount worked out under section 418-151
for the income year (the complying exploration credit amount).
Note:

The tax is imposed by the Excess Exploration Credit Tax Act 2014,
and the amount of the tax is set out in that Act.

418-151 Complying exploration credit amount
(1) The complying exploration credit amount (which may be nil) for
an income year is worked out by:
(a) starting with the sum of the *exploration credits the entity
issues for the income year; and
(b) subtracting from the result of paragraph (a) the sum of any of
those exploration credits covered by subsection (2); and
(c) if the result of paragraph (b) exceeds the entity’s *maximum
exploration credit amount for the income year—subtracting
from that result the amount of the excess.
Note:

The complying exploration credit amount is the sum of issued
exploration credits that were issued (and created) in compliance with
this Division. A liability arises under section 418-150 if the sum of all
issued exploration credits exceeds this amount.

(2) This subsection covers an *exploration credit to the extent to which
either or both of the following apply to the credit:
(a) the credit was issued in contravention of a requirement in this
Division;
(b) the credit was created in contravention of a requirement in
Subdivision 418-D (other than section 418-85).
Note:

Because the maximum exploration credit amount from section 418-85
is taken into account in paragraph (1)(c) of this section, it is
disregarded here.

419-1 What this Division is about
Companies may be entitled to a refundable tax offset for
expenditure incurred in carrying on processing activities at
facilities in Australia that substantially transform feedstock
containing critical minerals into purer or more refined forms of the
critical minerals that are chemically distinct from the feedstock.
This offset is designed to support the growth of these processing
activities in Australia.
One of the requirements for entitlement to the tax offset is for a
company to hold a registration certificate for these processing
activities and for the Australian facilities where the activities are to
be carried on. The Industry Secretary will decide whether to issue
the certificates. A registration can be in force for 10 income years
during the period starting on 1 July 2027 and ending on 30 June
2040.

about the activity; or
(b) comply with a request, given under subsection 419-80(2)
during an income year, for further information about the
registration.
Note 1:

The registration may be automatically revoked if the report or
requested information is not given before the end of an extended
period (see subsections 419-70(1) to (3)).

Note 2:

Suspending the registration will not suspend the maximum 10-year
period that the registration of the activity can be in force (see
section 419-50).

(2) For the purposes of this Division (other than this section), the
activity is taken:
(a) during the period of the suspension, never to have been
registered for the company and the income year mentioned in
paragraph (1)(a) or (b); but
(b) if that period ends, to have been registered during that period
for the company and the income year.
Paragraph (b) of this subsection is subject to the registration being
revoked under section 419-70.
Note:

This means that if an assessment of a company’s income tax for the
income year is made on the basis that the company is entitled to the
CMPTI tax offset for the activity, during the suspension the
assessment may be amended to take account of the fact that the
company was never entitled to the offset for the activity (see
section 419-90).

Automatic revocation if annual report or requested information is
not given before the end of an extended period

(a) the company eventually gives the *Industry Secretary:
(i) for subsection (1)—a report about the activity for the
previous income year that complies with
subsections 419-45(1) to (3); or
(ii) for subsection (2)—the requested further information in
a way that complies with subsection 419-80(4); and

report or information (the late material) to be accepted; and
(c) the application is in a form approved under

420-5 The 4 key features of tax accounting for registered emissions
units
The purpose of income tax accounting for registered emissions
units is to produce the same tax treatment, irrespective of your
purpose in acquiring or holding the registered emissions units.
There are 4 key features:
(1) You bring your gross expenditure and gross proceeds to account,
not your net profits and losses on disposal of a registered emissions
unit.
(2) The gross expenditure is deductible.
(3) The gross proceeds are assessable income.
(4) You must bring to account any difference between the value of
your registered emissions units held at the start and at the end of
the income year. This is done in such a way that:
(a) any increase in value is included in assessable income; and
(b) any decrease in value is a deduction.

you are treated as if:
(d) just before the transfer, you had sold the unit to someone else
for its *cost; and
(e) you had, immediately after the sale, bought it back as a
registered emissions unit for the same amount.
Example: An Australian resident company carries on a business of trading in
emissions units. The units are trading stock. The company owns
10,000 emission reduction units (a type of Kyoto unit) that are
registered in New Zealand. 5,000 of those emission reduction units are
transferred from the company’s New Zealand registry account to the
company’s Australian registry account.
The company is treated as having sold each unit to someone else at its
cost just before it became a registered emissions unit. As the unit was
previously held as trading stock, the unit ceases to be trading stock
(section 70-12). The cost of the unit just before it became a registered
emissions unit is included in the company’s assessable income.
The company is also treated as having bought 5,000 registered
emissions units for the same amount. The company is entitled to a
deduction for that amount (section 420-15).

Section 420-40
Example: An Australian resident company carries on a business of trading in
emission units. The company owns 10,000 emission reduction units (a
type of Kyoto unit) that are registered in Australia. 5,000 of those
units are transferred from the company’s Australian registry account
to the company’s New Zealand registry account.
The company is treated as having sold each unit to someone else at its
market value just before it stopped being a registered emissions unit.
As the unit was a registered emissions unit, the market value is
included in the company’s assessable income (section 420-25).
The company is also treated as having bought 5,000 emission
reduction units for the same amount. As those units are trading stock,
the company may be able to deduct that amount under section 8-1.

420-40 Disposal of registered emissions units for a purpose other
than gaining assessable income
(1) If:
(a) an entity (the first entity) incurs expenditure in:
(i) becoming the *holder of a *registered emissions unit; or
(ii) ceasing to hold a registered emissions unit; and
(b) the first entity has deducted or can deduct the expenditure
under section 420-15 or 420-42; and
(c) the first entity ceases to hold the unit in a particular income
year; and
(d) the cessation is neither:
(i) in gaining or producing the first entity’s assessable
income; nor
(ii) in carrying on a *business for the purpose of gaining or
producing the first entity’s assessable income; and
(e) section 420-30 (non-arm’s length transactions and
transactions with associates) did not apply to the first entity
ceasing to hold the unit;
the first entity’s assessable income for that income year includes an
amount equal to the amount the first entity has deducted or can
deduct.

(c) the *registered emissions unit devolves to the first entity’s
*legal personal representative;
then:
(d) the first entity’s legal personal representative is treated as
having bought the unit for the amount included in the first
entity’s assessable income under subsection (1); and
(e) if the unit *passes to a beneficiary in the first entity’s estate:
(i) the first entity’s legal personal representative is treated
as having disposed of the unit for the amount included
in the first entity’s assessable income under
subsection (1); and
(ii) the beneficiary is treated as having bought the unit for
the amount included in the first entity’s assessable
income under subsection (1).
(3) If:
