200-5 The imputation system
The *imputation system partially integrates the income tax
liabilities of an Australian corporate tax entity and its members by:
(a) allowing the entity, when distributing profits to its members,
to pass to those members credit for income tax paid by the
entity on those profits; and
(b) allowing the entity’s Australian members to claim a tax
offset for that credit; and

(c) allowing the entity’s Australian members to claim a refund if
they are unable to fully utilise the tax offset in reducing their
income tax.

200-10 Franking a distribution
When an Australian corporate tax entity distributes profits to its
members, the entity has the option of passing to those members
credit for income tax paid by the entity on the profits. This is done
by franking the distribution.

200-15 The franking account
(1) A franking account is used to keep track of income tax paid by the
entity, so that the entity can pass to its members the benefit of
having paid that tax when a distribution is made.
(2) Each corporate tax entity has a franking account.
(3) Typically, a corporate tax entity receives a credit in the account if
the entity pays income tax or receives a franked distribution. A
credit in the franking account is called a franking credit.
(4) Typically, a corporate tax entity receives a debit in the account if
the entity receives a refund of tax or franks a distribution to its
members. A debit in the franking account is called a franking debit.

200-20 How a distribution is franked
(1) A corporate tax entity franks a distribution by allocating a franking
credit to it.
(2) The amount of the franking credit on the distribution is the amount
specified in a statement that accompanies the distribution.
(3) Only some kinds of distribution can be franked. These are called
frankable distributions.

Section 200-25
200-25 A corporate tax entity must not give its members credit for
more tax than the entity has paid
(1) A corporate tax entity must not frank a distribution from profits
with a franking credit that exceeds the maximum amount of
income tax that could have been paid, at the entity’s corporate tax
rate for imputation purposes for the income year in which the
distribution is made, on the profits distributed.
(2) If a distribution is franked in excess of this limit, the entity will be
taken to have franked the distribution with the maximum franking
credit for the distribution.

200-30 Benchmark rule
(1) All frankable distributions made within a particular period must be
franked to the same extent. This is the benchmark rule.
(2) It is designed to ensure that one member of a corporate tax entity is
not preferred over another by the manner in which distributions are
franked.

200-35 Effect of receiving a franked distribution
(1) Under Division 207, if an Australian member of a corporate tax
entity receives a franked distribution, the member can usually
offset, against the member’s own income tax liability, income tax
paid by the entity on the profits underlying the distribution.
(2) The tax offset to which the member is entitled is equal to the
franking credit on the distribution.
Note 1:

A member may be entitled to a refund under Division 67 if the sum of
the tax offset and certain other tax offsets exceeds the amount of
income tax that the member would have to pay if the member had not
got those tax offsets.

Note 2:

If the member is not a resident, the tax effects of receiving a
distribution will be dealt with under Division 11A of Part III of the
Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, and Subdivision 207-D of this Part.

over others when passing on the benefits of having paid
income tax; and
(c) the *membership of a corporate tax entity is not manipulated
to create either of the outcomes mentioned in paragraphs (a)
and (b).

The object of this Subdivision is to ensure that only distributions
equivalent to realised taxed profits can be franked.

202-40 Frankable distributions
(1) A *distribution is a frankable distribution, to the extent that it is
not unfrankable under section 202-45.

(c) where the purchase price on the buy-back of a *share by a
*company from one of its *members is taken to be a dividend
under section 159GZZZP of the Income Tax Assessment Act
1936—so much of that purchase price as exceeds what would
be the market value (as normally understood) of the share at
the time of the buy-back if the buy-back did not take place
and were never proposed to take place;
(d) a *distribution in respect of a *non-equity share;
(e) a distribution that is sourced, directly or indirectly, from a
company’s *share capital account;

Section 202-55
202-55 What is the maximum franking credit for a frankable
distribution?
The maximum franking credit for a distribution is equivalent to the
maximum amount of income tax that the entity making the
distribution could have paid, at the entity’s corporate tax rate for
imputation purposes for the income year in which the distribution
is made, on the profits underlying the distribution.

Operative provisions
202-60 Amount of the franking credit on a distribution
(1) The amount of the *franking credit on a *distribution is that stated
in the *distribution statement for the distribution, unless that
amount exceeds the *maximum franking credit for the distribution.
(2) The maximum franking credit for a *distribution is worked out
using the formula:
Amount of the *frankable distribution ´

1
Applicable gross-up rate

where:
applicable gross-up rate means the *corporate tax gross-up rate of
the entity making the distribution for the income year in which the
distribution is made.

202-65 Where the franking credit stated in the distribution
statement exceeds the maximum franking credit for the
distribution
If the amount of a *franking credit stated in a *distribution
statement for a *distribution exceeds the *maximum franking credit
for the distribution, the amount of the franking credit on the
distribution is taken to be the amount of the maximum franking
credit for the distribution, and not the amount stated in the
distribution statement.

(4) However, the entity is not allowed to give the statement at a later
time under subsection (3) if the statement indicates that a *franking
credit has been allocated to the *distribution and the franking credit
would, either alone or when added to other franking credits
allocated to other distributions made by the entity during the

Note:

The combined effect of subsections (3) and (4) is that a private
company can retrospectively frank a distribution, but not so as to
create or increase a liability for franking deficit tax.

(1) A distribution statement is a statement made in accordance with
this section.
(2) The statement must be in the *approved form.
(3) The statement must:
(a) identify the entity making the distribution; and
(b) state the date on which the distribution is made; and
(c) state the amount of the distribution; and
(d) state that there is a *franking credit of an amount specified on
the distribution; and
(e) state the *franking percentage for the distribution; and

Section 203-25
(2) The following are examples of cases in which a company satisfies
the criteria set out in paragraph (1)(a):
(a) the company is a *listed public company with a single *class
of *membership interest at all times during the relevant
*franking period;
(b) the company is a listed public company that, under its
constituent documents, must not:
(i) make a *distribution on one membership interest during
the relevant franking period without making a
distribution under the same resolution on all other
membership interests; or
(ii) *frank a distribution made on one membership interest
during the relevant franking period without franking
distributions made on all other membership interests
under the same resolution with a *franking credit
worked out using the same *franking percentage;
(c) the company is a listed public company with more than one
class of membership interest, but the rights in relation to
distributions and the franking of distributions are the same
for each class of membership interest.
This is not an exhaustive list.
(3) For the purposes of subsection (1), ignore *membership interests
that do not carry a right to receive *distributions (other than
distributions on the winding up of the company).

203-25 Benchmark rule
An entity must not make a *frankable distribution whose *franking
percentage differs from the entity’s *benchmark franking
percentage for the *franking period in which the distribution is
made. This is the benchmark rule.
Note:

If a corporate tax entity franks a distribution in breach of this rule, the
distribution will still be a franked distribution, although consequences
will flow under section 203-50.

Section 203-30
203-30 Setting a benchmark franking percentage
The benchmark franking percentage for an entity for a *franking
period is the same as the *franking percentage for the first
*frankable distribution made by the entity within the period.
Note:

If no frankable distribution is made during the period, there is no
benchmark franking percentage for the period.

203-35 Franking percentage
(1) Subject to subsection (2), the franking percentage for a *frankable
distribution is worked out using the formula:
*Franking credit allocated
to the *frankable distribution
× 100
*Maximum franking credit
for the distribution

(2) If the *franking percentage for a *frankable distribution would
exceed 100% if it were worked out under subsection (1), it is taken
to be 100%.

203-40 Franking periods—where the entity is not a private company
(1) Use this section to work out the franking periods for an entity in an
income year where the entity is not a *private company for the
income year.
(2) If the entity’s income year is a period of 12 months, each of the
following is a franking period for the entity in that year:
(a) the period of 6 months beginning at the start of the entity’s
income year;
(b) the remainder of the income year.
(3) If the entity’s income year is a period of 6 months or less, the
franking period for the entity in that year is the same as the
income year.

(a) the period of 6 months beginning at the start of the entity’s
income year (the first franking period);
(b) the period of 6 months beginning immediately after the end
of the first franking period;
(c) the remainder of the income year.

203-45 Franking period—private companies
The franking period for an entity that is a *private company for an
income year is the same as the income year.

203-50 Consequences of breaching the benchmark rule
(1) If an entity makes a *frankable distribution in breach of the
*benchmark rule:
(a) the entity is liable to pay over-franking tax imposed by the
New Business Tax System (Over-franking Tax) Act 2002 if
the *franking percentage for the *distribution exceeds the
entity’s *benchmark franking percentage for the *franking
period in which the distribution is made; and
(b) a *franking debit arises in the entity’s *franking account if the
franking percentage for the distribution is less than the
entity’s benchmark franking percentage for the franking
period in which the distribution is made.

Applicable gross-up rate

where:
applicable gross-up rate means the *corporate tax gross-up rate of
the entity making the distribution for the income year in which the

franking % differential is the difference between:
(a) the *franking percentage for the *frankable distribution; and
(b) either:
(i) if subparagraph (ii) does not apply—the entity’s
*benchmark franking percentage for the *franking
period in which the *distribution is made; or
(ii) if the Commissioner in the exercise of the
Commissioner’s powers under subsection 203-55(1),
permits the entity to frank the distribution at a different
franking percentage—that percentage.
Example: An entity makes 3 successive frankable distributions in a franking
period. Each of those distributions is represented in the following
diagram. The franking percentage for the first distribution is 40%, and
so the entity’s benchmark franking percentage for the period is 40%.

203-55 Commissioner’s powers to permit a departure from the
benchmark rule
Powers of the Commissioner
(1) The Commissioner may, on application by an entity, make a
determination in writing permitting the entity to *frank a
*distribution at a *franking percentage that differs from the entity’s
*benchmark franking percentage for the *franking period in which
the distribution is made.
(2) Because the *benchmark rule is an integral part of the imputation
system, the Commissioner’s powers under this section may only be
exercised in extraordinary circumstances.
Matters to which the Commissioner must have regard in exercising
the power
(3) In deciding whether there are extraordinary circumstances
justifying the exercise of the Commissioner’s power to make a
determination under subsection (1), the Commissioner must have
regard to:
(a) the entity’s reasons for departing, or proposing to depart,
from the *benchmark rule; and
(b) the extent of the departure, or proposed departure, from the
benchmark rule; and
(c) if the circumstances that give rise to the entity’s application
are within the entity’s control, the extent to which the entity
has sought the exercise of the Commissioner’s powers under
this section in the past; and
(d) whether a *member of the entity has been or will be
disadvantaged as a result of the departure, or proposed
departure, from the benchmark rule; and
(e) whether a *member of the entity will receive greater
*imputation benefits than another member of the entity
because a distribution *franked at a *franking percentage that
differs from the *benchmark franking percentage for the
*franking period is made to one of them; and

Commissioner’s power to make a determination when distributions
or distributions and other benefits are streamed
(1) This section empowers the Commissioner to make determinations
if an entity streams one or more *distributions (or one or more
distributions and the giving of other benefits), whether in a single
*franking period or in a number of franking periods, in such a way
that:
(a) an *imputation benefit is, or apart from this section would be,
received by a *member of the entity as a result of the
distribution or distributions; and
(b) the member would *derive a *greater benefit from franking
credits than another member of the entity; and
(c) the other member of the entity will receive lesser imputation
benefits, or will not receive any imputation benefits, whether
or not the other member receives other benefits.
The member that derives the greater benefit from franking credits
is the favoured member. The member that receives the lesser
imputation benefits is the disadvantaged member.
Examples of other benefits
(2) These are examples of the giving of other benefits:
(a) issuing bonus *shares;
(b) returning *paid-up share capital;
(c) *forgiving a debt;
(d) the entity or another entity making a payment of any kind, or
giving any property, to a *member or to another person on a
member’s behalf.
Nature of the determination that the Commissioner may make
(3) The Commissioner may make one or more of these determinations:

205-5 Franking accounts, franking deficit tax liabilities and the
related tax offset
(1) Each entity that is, or has ever been, a corporate tax entity has a
franking account.
(2) The payment of a PAYG instalment or income tax will generate a
franking credit in that account. The amount of the credit is equal to
the amount of tax paid. The receipt of a franked distribution by an
entity from another corporate tax entity will also generate a
franking credit. There are other circumstances in which a franking
credit arises.
(3) The receipt of a refund of income tax or the payment of a franked
distribution by a corporate tax entity will generate a franking debit.
There are, however, other cases where a franking debit arises. For
example, a franking debit might arise under a determination by the
Commissioner because distributions have been streamed.
(4) An entity must be a franking entity at certain times and satisfy
certain residency requirements before a franking credit or debit
arises in its account.
(5) Franking deficit tax is payable if the franking account of an entity
is in deficit at the end of the entity’s income year, or when the
entity ceases to be a franking entity.
(6) A tax offset is available to an entity that has incurred a liability to
pay franking deficit tax.

Method statement
Step 1.

Identify any income years ending before the payment was
made for which the entity has *received a refund of
income tax.

Step 2.

Add up the part (if any) of each of those refunds that is
attributable to a *tax offset that is subject to the

(For this purpose, assume a credit reduced to zero is still
a franking credit.)

(5) The proportion is the standard corporate tax rate (within the
meaning of Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936)
divided by 40%.

entity is not liable at the time when the payment is made).

(2) If an entity:
(a) is liable to pay a *PAYG instalment; and

credit or payment can be applied to reduce that liability.
(3) An entity pays income tax if and only if:
(a) the entity has a liability to pay the income tax; and
(b) either:
(i) the entity makes a payment to satisfy the liability (in
whole or in part); or
(ii) a credit, or an *RBA surplus, is applied to discharge or
reduce the liability.

year is included in the RBA; and
(c) the RBA does not include the liability to pay the *PAYG
instalment; and
(d) the amount of the credit exceeds the income tax assessed to
the entity in respect of that income year;
the amount of the PAYG instalment paid by virtue of the

205-70 Tax offset arising from franking deficit tax liabilities
When does the tax offset arise?
(1) A *corporate tax entity is entitled to a *tax offset for an income
year for which it satisfies the *residency requirement (the relevant
year) if at least one of the following applies:
(a) the entity has incurred a liability to pay *franking deficit tax
in the relevant year;
(b) the entity incurred such a liability in a previous income year
for which it did not satisfy the residency requirement, and
that liability has not been taken into account in working out a
tax offset under this section;
(c) when the entity was last entitled to a tax offset under this
section for a previous income year, some of the offset
remained after applying section 63-10 (tax offset priority
rules).
The amount of the tax offset
(2) Work out the amount of the *tax offset for the relevant year as
follows:
Method statement
Step 1.

Work out the total amount of *franking deficit tax that is
covered by paragraph (1)(a).
Then, subject to subsections (5) and (6), reduce so much
of it as is attributable to *franking debits to which
subsection (8) applies by 30% if that part exceeds 10% of
the total amount of *franking credits that arose in the
entity’s *franking account for the relevant year.

Step 2.

Work out the total amount of *franking deficit tax that is
covered by paragraph (1)(b) for a previous income year.

*tax offset to which the entity is entitled under this
section for the relevant year.

Note:

This method statement is modified for certain late balancing entities:
see section 205-70 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act
1997.

Example: The following apply to a corporate tax entity that satisfies the
residency requirement for an income year:
•
the entity’s income tax liability for that year would be $100,000
if its tax offsets were disregarded;
•
for that year, the entity has a tax offset of $60,000 under this
section (the franking deficit offset) and a tax offset of $80,000 in
respect of foreign income tax paid by the entity (the foreign
income tax offset).
Under section 63-10 (about tax offset priority rules), the foreign
income tax offset must be applied before the franking deficit offset is
applied. As a result, that offset and $20,000 of the franking deficit
offset combine to reduce the entity’s income tax liability to nil. The
remaining $40,000 of the franking deficit offset will be included in a
franking deficit offset for the next income year for which the entity
satisfies the residency requirement.

Residency requirement
(4) To determine whether the entity satisfies the *residency
requirement for the relevant year, section 205-25 has effect as if

(1) If a corporate tax entity makes a franked distribution to one of its
members, then, as a general rule:
(a) an amount equal to the franking credit on the distribution is
included in the member’s assessable income; and
(b) the member is entitled to a tax offset equal to the same
amount.
(2) In some cases a residency requirement must be satisfied for the
general rule to apply.

the distribution is also included in the member’s assessable income
as mentioned in paragraph (1)(a).
(4) However, a tax offset in relation to that distribution is only
available to an entity (who may be a partner, beneficiary or a
trustee) if the distribution flows indirectly to it and does not flow
indirectly through it to another entity. The tax offset is equal to its
share of the franking credit on the distribution.
Note:

That share is a notional amount and the entity can have that share
without actually receiving any of that franking credit or distribution.

(5) There are exceptions to both the general rule mentioned in
subsection (1) and the special rule mentioned in subsection (4).
Basically, these exceptions are created:
(a) where the relevant entity would not have paid tax on the
distribution or a share of the distribution (see
Subdivisions 207-D and 207-E); and
(b) where there is a manipulation of the imputation system in a
manner that is not permitted under the income tax law (see
Subdivision 207-F).

(1) If:
(a) a *franked distribution is made in an income year to an entity
that is a partnership or the trustee of a trust; and
(b) the entity is not a *corporate tax entity when the distribution
is made; and
(c) if the entity is the trustee of a trust—the trust is not a

made;
the assessable income of the partnership or trust for that income
year includes the amount of the *franking credit on the distribution.
(2) The amount is in addition to any other amount included in that
assessable income in relation to the distribution under any other
provision of this Act.
Note:

The amount will affect the income tax liability of a partner in the

income for that year that is attributable to all or a part of the
distribution.
(4) Despite any provisions in Divisions 5 and 6 of Part III of the
Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the entity’s assessable income
for that year also includes:
(a) in the case of an entity that is a partner in a partnership—so
much of the franking credit amount as is equal to the entity’s
*share of the *franking credit on the distribution; and
(b) in the case of an entity that is a beneficiary of a trust:
(i) so much of the franking credit amount as is equal to the
entity’s share of the franking credit on the distribution;
and
(ii) the amount mentioned in section 207-37.
Example: A franked distribution of $70 is made to the trustee of a trust in an
income year. The trust also has $100 of assessable income from other
sources. Under subsection (1), the trust’s assessable income includes
an additional amount of $30 (which is the franking credit on the
distribution). The trust has a net income of $200 for that income year.
There are 2 beneficiaries of the trust, P and Q, who are presently
entitled to the trust’s income. Under the trust deed, P is entitled to all
of the franked distribution and Q is entitled to all other income.
The distribution flows indirectly to P (as P has a share of the trust’s
net income that is covered by paragraph 97(1)(a) and has a share of
the distribution under section 207-55 equal to 100% of the
distribution).
Under this subsection, P’s assessable income includes $70 (the
amount mentioned in section 207-37 (attributable franked
distribution)) and also includes the full amount of the franking credit
(as P’s share of the franking credit on the distribution is $30 under
section 207-57). Q’s assessable income does not include any of the
amount of the franked distribution or the franking credit.

(5) Subsection (6) applies if:
(a) a *franked distribution is made, or *flows indirectly, to the
trustee of a trust in an income year; and
(b) the assessable income of the trust for that year includes an

(a) during that income year, the distribution is made to the
partnership, or *flows indirectly to the partnership as a
beneficiary because of a previous application of
subsection (3); and
(b) the partner has an individual interest:
(i) in the partnership’s *net income for that income year
that is covered by paragraph 92(1)(a) or (b) of the
Income Tax Assessment Act 1936; or
(ii) in a *partnership loss of the partnership for that income
year that is covered by paragraph 92(2)(a) or (b) of that
Act;
(whether or not that individual interest becomes assessable
income in the hands of the partner); and
(c) the partner’s *share of the distribution under section 207-55
is a positive amount (whether or not the partner actually
receives any of that share).

(c) the trustee’s *share of the distribution under section 207-55 is

Note:

A trustee to whom a franked distribution flows indirectly under this
subsection is entitled to a tax offset under section 207-45 and the
distribution does not flow indirectly through the trustee to another
entity.

(5) A *franked distribution flows indirectly through an entity (the first
entity) to another entity if, and only if:
(a) the other entity is the focal entity in an item of the table in
section 207-55 in relation to the distribution; and
(b) that focal entity’s *share of the distribution is based on the
first entity’s share of the distribution as an intermediary
entity in that or another item of the table.
Example: A franked distribution of $140 is made to a partnership. An amount
equal to the franking credit on the distribution ($60) is included in the
partnership’s assessable income under section 207-35. Because the
partnership has losses of $300 from other sources, it has a partnership
loss of $100 for the income year.
The partnership has 2 equal partners. One partner is the trustee of a
trust and the other partner is an individual. The distribution flows
indirectly to each partner under subsection (2). Each partner has a
share of the partnership loss ($50), a share of the distribution under
sections 207-55 ($70) and a share of the franking credit under
section 207-57 ($30).
The individual partner is allowed a tax offset of $30 under
section 207-45.
Because the trust has $100 of income from other sources, it has a net
income of $50 for that income year ($100 minus the share of the
partnership loss of $50).
The trust has one individual as a beneficiary, to whom the distribution
flows indirectly under subsection (3). The beneficiary’s share of the
franked distribution is therefore $70 under sections 207-55 and its

beneficiary is also allowed a tax offset of $30 under section 207-45.

207-55 Share of a franked distribution
Object of section
(1) The object of this section is to ensure that:
(a) the amount of a *franked distribution made to a partnership
or the trustee of a trust is allocated notionally amongst
entities who *derive benefits from that distribution; and
(b) that allocation corresponds with the way in which those
benefits were derived.
Note:

An entity can derive a benefit from the distribution (and therefore has
a share of the distribution) without actually receiving any of the
distribution: see subsection (2) of this section and the example at the
end of section 207-50.

(2) An entity’s share of a *franked distribution is an amount notionally
allocated to the entity as its share of the distribution, whether or not
the entity actually receives any of that distribution.
(3) That amount is equal to the entity’s share of the distribution as the
focal entity in column 3 of an item of the table.
Note:

An entity’s share of the distribution is based on the share of the
distribution of each preceding intermediary entity through which the
distribution flows, starting from the intermediary entity to whom the
distribution is made.
This means that in some cases (see items 2 and 4), more than one item
of the table will need to be applied to work out the share of the
distribution of an ultimate recipient of the distribution.

Note:

This section can therefore apply, for example, where the entity is a

Partner
(2) If the *franked distribution *flows indirectly to the entity as a
partner in a partnership under subsection 207-50(2), the entity can
deduct an amount for that income year that is equal to its *share of
the *franking credit on the distribution.
Beneficiary
(3) If the *franked distribution *flows indirectly to the entity as a
beneficiary of a trust under subsection 207-50(3), the entity can
deduct an amount for that income year that is equal to the lesser of:
(a) its share amount in relation to the distribution that is
mentioned in that subsection; and
(b) its *share of the *franking credit on the distribution.
Trustee
(4) If the *franked distribution *flows indirectly to the entity as the
trustee of a trust under subsection 207-50(4), the entity’s share
amount in relation to the distribution that is mentioned in that
subsection is to be reduced by the lesser of:
(a) that share amount; and
(b) its *share of the *franking credit on the distribution.
Example: A franked distribution of $70 is made to a partnership.
Under section 207-35, an additional amount of $30 is included in the
partnership’s assessable income because of the distribution.
The partnership has 2 equal partners, X and Y. X is a foreign resident
individual whose share of partnership’s net income for the income
year is $50 (share of distribution of $35 and share of franking credit of

207-157 Distribution washing
(1) This section applies to a *franked distribution received by a
*member of a *corporate tax entity on a *membership interest (the
washed interest) if:
(a) the washed interest was acquired after the member, or a
*connected entity of the member, disposed of a substantially
identical membership interest; and

or the connected entity, on the substantially identical interest.
Further requirement for connected entities
(2) However, if the entity that disposed of the substantially identical
interest was a *connected entity of the member, this section does
not apply to the *franked distribution unless:
(a) it would be concluded that the disposal took place wholly or
partly because there was an expectation that the acquisition
would, or would be likely to, take place; or
(b) it would be concluded that the acquisition took place wholly
or partly because there was a belief that the disposal had
taken place.
Substantially identical interests
(3) Without limiting paragraph (1)(a), for the purpose of that
paragraph a *membership interest is substantially identical to the
washed interest if it is any one or more of the following:
(a) fungible with, or economically equivalent to, the washed
interest;
(b) a membership interest in the same *corporate tax entity as the
washed interest and of a class that is the same as, or not
materially different from, the washed interest;

Division 208 Exempting entities and former exempting entities

Section 208-10
(a) look at the membership interests in the entity that involve the
holder of the interest in bearing the risks and accruing the
opportunities of ownership of the entity; and
(b) ask whether at least 95% of those membership interests, and
95% of any interests in those membership interests, are held
by Australian residents or entities that receive distributions as
exempt income or non-assessable non-exempt income.

208-10 Former exempting entities
When an entity ceases to be an exempting entity, it becomes a
former exempting entity.

208-15 Distributions by exempting entities and former exempting
entities
To ensure that franking credits accumulated by an exempting entity
are not the target of franking credit trading, these rules:
(a) limit the circumstances in which a distribution franked with
those credits can give rise to benefits under the imputation
system; and
(b) quarantine those credits by moving them into a separate
account, called the exempting account, when the entity
ceases to be an exempting entity; and
(c) deny a recipient of a distribution franked with a credit from
that account any benefit under the imputation system as a
result of that distribution, unless the recipient was a member
of the entity immediately before it became a former
exempting entity.

A *corporate tax entity is an exempting entity at a particular time
if, at that time, the entity is effectively owned by prescribed
persons.
Note:

Prescribed persons are identified in sections 208-40 and 208-45.

208-25 Effective ownership of entity by prescribed persons
(1) An entity is effectively owned by prescribed persons at a particular
time if:
(a) at that time:
(i) not less than 95% of the *accountable membership
interests in the entity; or
(ii) not less than 95% of the *accountable partial interests in
the entity;
are held by, or held indirectly for the benefit of, prescribed
persons; or
(b) paragraph (a) does not apply but it would nevertheless be
reasonable to conclude that, at that time, the risks involved
in, and the opportunities resulting from, holding accountable
membership interests, or accountable partial interests, in the
entity that are not held by, or directly or indirectly for the
benefit of, prescribed persons are substantially borne by, or
substantially accrue to, prescribed persons.
(2) In deciding whether it would be reasonable to conclude as
mentioned in paragraph (1)(b):

interests (including unissued membership interests), or in
respect of *partial interests, in the entity (including any

is aware; but
(b) do not have regard to risks involved in the ownership of

are substantially borne by any person in the person’s capacity
as a secured creditor.
(3) An entity has a partial interest in a *corporate tax entity if it has an
interest in a *membership interest in the corporate tax entity.

208-30 Accountable membership interests
(1) The purpose of this section is to identify which *membership
interests in an entity are relevant in determining whether the entity
is effectively owned by prescribed persons.
(2) A *membership interest in an entity is an accountable membership
interest if it is not an excluded membership interest.
(3) A *membership interest in an entity is an excluded membership
interest if, having regard to:
(a) the purposes for which the membership interest was issued;
and
(b) any special or limited rights connected with, arising from, or
attached to:
(i) the membership interest; or
(ii) other membership interests in the entity held by the
holder of the membership interest; or
(iii) membership interests in the entity held by persons other
than the holder of the membership interest; or
(iv) interests in any of the above;
including rights that are conferred or exercisable only if the
holder of the membership interest or interests concerned is,
or is not, a prescribed person; and
(c) the extent to which any such special or limited rights are
similar to or differ from the rights that are normally attached

it would be reasonable to conclude that the membership interest is
not relevant in determining whether the entity is effectively owned

does not involve the holder bearing the risks, or result in the
accrual to the holder of the opportunities, of ownership of the
entity that ordinarily arise from, or are ordinarily attached to, the
holding of ordinary membership interests in an entity.
(4) In applying subsection (3), the fact that a person is a trustee is to be
disregarded.
(5) Without limiting subsection (3), a *membership interest in an entity
held by a person who is not a prescribed person is an excluded
membership interest if:
(a) it is a finance membership interest; or
(b) it is a distribution access membership interest; or
(c) it does not carry the right to receive distributions; or

(7) A *membership interest to which subsection (6) does not apply is a
finance membership interest if:
(a) the manner in which the *distributions payable in respect of
the membership interest are calculated, and the conditions
applying to the payment of such distributions, indicate that
the distributions paid are equivalent to the receipt by the
person to whom they are paid of interest or an amount in the

will be redeemed or, because of an *arrangement between the
holder and the entity or an *associate of the entity, it is
reasonable for the holder to expect that the capital will be
redeemed, for an amount that is not less than, or for property
(including other membership interests in the entity) the value
of which is not less than, the amount paid for the membership
interest; or
(c) the membership interest is redeemable by the entity by
payment of a lump sum or by the transfer of property, or the
membership interest has a preferred right to a repayment of
capital on a winding up, where the amount of the lump sum
or the value of the property, or the amount of the capital to be
repaid, as the case may be, is to be calculated by reference to
an implicit interest rate.
(8) A *membership interest in an entity is a distribution access
membership interest if, having regard to:
(a) the terms of the issue of the membership interest, including
any guarantee of payment of distributions; and
(b) the amounts of the *distributions paid on the membership
interest relative to the issue price of the membership interest;
and
(c) whether there is any guaranteed rate at which *franked
distributions are to be paid on the membership interest; and

investment. If the PDF makes a distribution franked with a venture
capital credit, the relevant venture capital investor receives a
certain part of a distribution from the PDF as exempt income and,
in addition, is entitled to a tax offset equal to the venture capital
credit.

210-10 What is a venture capital credit?
(1) There is a venture capital franking sub-account in the franking
account of each PDF.
(2) Venture capital credits arise in the sub-account if the PDF pays
income tax that is reasonably attributable to capital gains from
venture capital investments.

210-15 What does the PDF have to do to distribute the credits?
Only a participating PDF can distribute venture capital credits. A
PDF elects to participate by keeping a record of its venture capital
sub-account.

210-20 Limits on venture capital franking
(1) The venture capital credit on a distribution cannot exceed the
franking credit on the distribution. It is, in this sense, a species of
franking credit.
(2) A PDF can only distribute venture capital credits if it does it so that
all members of the PDF receive venture capital credits in
proportion to their holdings.
(3) If a PDF has a venture capital surplus when it makes a distribution,
it must frank the distribution with venture capital credits.
(4) There are measures to ensure that a PDF does not maintain a
venture capital deficit over a prolonged period.

frankable with venture capital credits is made
(1) If a *participating PDF would otherwise have a *venture capital
surplus at the time a *distribution that is *frankable with a venture
capital credit is made, the PDF must either:
(a) allocate a *venture capital credit to the distribution that is
equal to the *franking credit on the distribution; or
(b) allocate a venture capital credit to the distribution that either
alone or when added to venture capital credits allocated to
other distributions made under the resolution of the PDF
under which the distribution in question is made, reduces the
surplus to nil, or creates a *venture capital deficit.
(2) A *venture capital debit arises for a *participating PDF when a
*distribution is made if the PDF does not allocate a *venture capital
credit in accordance with subsection (1). The amount of the debit
is:
Subsection (1) franked amount  Actual franked amount

where:
actual franked amount is the amount of the *venture capital credit
that is allocated to the *distribution by the PDF (this may be nil).
subsection (1) franked amount is the amount of the *venture
capital credit that would have been allocated to the *distribution if
the PDF had made the smallest allocation needed to satisfy
subsection (1).

franked with a venture capital credit.

210-95 Venture capital deficit tax
(1) Venture capital deficit tax is payable if a PDF’s venture capital
sub-account is in deficit at the end of the PDF’s income year, or
immediately before it ceases to be a PDF.
(2) A PDF’s venture capital sub-account may be in deficit, even if its
franking account is not. This can happen because only income tax
on income of a particular kind (capital gains on venture capital
investments) gives rise to venture capital credits. This means that
when a PDF anticipates a venture capital credit, it is not only
anticipating that income tax will be paid, but that income tax on
income of that kind will be paid. Although income tax may, in fact,
later be paid, it will not necessarily be income of the kind that
would give rise to a venture capital credit. This results in franking
credits arising even while the venture capital sub-account remains
in deficit.
(3) The discrepancy between the franking account balance and the
venture capital sub-account balance can also arise because venture
capital credits do not necessarily arise at the same time as the
relevant franking credits and debits (see item 1 of the table in
section 210-105 and item 2 of the table in section 210-120).

The balance in the venture capital sub-account on 1 July 2002 will be

immediately before 1 July 2002 under the imputation scheme existing
at that time, an amount calculated under the Income Tax (Transitional
Provisions) Act 1997.

These provisions:
(a) allow the Commissioner to gather sufficient information to
determine whether tax is payable by a corporate tax entity
under the imputation system; and
(b) provide for the Commissioner to assess the amount of tax
that is payable; and
(c) specify when the tax is payable; and
(d) establish systems to support the assessment and collection of
the tax.

214-5 Key features
(1) Initial information about a corporate tax entity’s franking activities
is provided by means of a return, called a franking return, given by
the entity to the Commissioner.

(2) The Commissioner is able to make a legislative instrument
requiring corporate tax entities to give a franking return for an
income year.
(3) The Commissioner is also able to require a particular corporate tax
entity to give a franking return for one or more income years. The
Commissioner might do this, for example, if the Commissioner
wishes to audit the corporate tax entity’s franking activities over a
number of years.
(4) The Commissioner may assess whether tax is payable under the
imputation system and the amount of that tax.
(5) In most cases, this is done by treating the first franking return of a
corporate tax entity for an income year as an assessment by the
Commissioner. To this extent, there is self-assessment.
(6) An assessment by the Commissioner is conclusive evidence of a
corporate tax entity’s tax liabilities under the imputation system,
except for the purposes of objection, review and appeal processes
under Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (see
section 350-10 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act

*permanent establishment of the ADI in a *listed country; and
(d) the funds from the issue of the non-share equity interest are
raised and applied solely for one or more purposes permitted
under subsection (2) in relation to the non-share equity
interest.
(2) The permitted purposes in relation to the *non-share equity interest
(the relevant interest) are the following:

unavailable
(1) If:
(a) a *corporate tax entity pays a *non-share dividend; and

(a) a *corporate tax entity pays a *non-share dividend that is not
one of a number of non-share dividends paid at the same
time; and
(b) immediately before the payment, the amount of the *available
frankable profits of the entity, although greater than nil, are
less than the amount of the non-share dividend;
the entity is taken to have made a frankable distribution equal to
the amount of the available frankable profits. The remainder of the
dividend is taken to be an unfrankable distribution.
(3) If:
(a) a *corporate tax entity pays a *non-share dividend that is one
of a number paid at the same time; and

has resolved (formally or informally) to paying such
distributions at a later time—the amounts of those

Method statement
Step 1.

Work out the part of the company’s total *income tax
liability for the income year that is attributable to the
company’s shareholders.
The result of this step is the shareholders’ share of the
income tax liability of the company for the income year.

Step 2.

Divide the step 1 result by that total *income tax liability.
The result of this step is the shareholders’ ratio for the
income year.

Step 3.

Multiply the amount of the payment or refund by the
*shareholders’ ratio.
The result of this step is the part of the payment or refund
that is attributable to the *shareholders’ share of the
*income tax liability of the company for the income year.

(3) For the purposes of this Part, the estimate mentioned in item 1 of
the table in section 219-15 (the part of a payment estimated to be
attributable to the *shareholders’ share of a company’s *income tax
liability for an income year) must be worked out on the basis of:
(a) subject to paragraph (b), the method statement in
subsection (2); and
(b) the company’s reasonable estimate of the amounts that, on
the company’s *assessment day for the income year, will be:
(i) its total income tax liability for the income year; and
(ii) the part of that total income tax liability that is
attributable to its shareholders.
(4) In working out the part of the *income tax liability of a *life
insurance company that is attributable to the shareholders of the
company for the purposes of this section, regard is to be had to the
accounting records of the company.

assessment is different from the shareholders’ ratio used
previously in relation to that income year to work out a
*franking credit or *franking debit for the company; and
(c) the franking account would have a different balance on the
adjustment day if the new ratio had been used to work out all
the franking credits and franking debits covered by
paragraph (b).

appropriate) of the amount worked out under subsection (3) arises
in the *franking account.
(3) The amount is an adjustment that will bring the *franking account
to the balance that it would have on the adjustment day if the new
ratio had been used to work out all the *franking credits and
*franking debits covered by paragraph (1)(b).
Example: On the basis of a shareholders’ ratio of 60% for the income year,
franking credits of the amounts of $6,000, $6,000, $6,000 and $6,000
arose under item 2 of the table in section 219-15 for Company X.
An amended assessment results in a new shareholders’ ratio of 70%.
Under this section, a franking credit of $4,000 arises on the day of the
amended assessment to bring the balance of the franking account from
$24,000 to $28,000, which would be the account’s balance if the new
shareholders’ ratio had been used.

Section 219-70
219-70 Tax offset under section 205-70
(1) For the purposes of paragraph 205-70(1)(c), if a *life insurance
company was entitled to a *tax offset under section 205-70 for a
previous income year, assume section 63-10 applied to the part of
the company’s basic income tax liability for that previous income
year that was attributable to its shareholders.
(2) In working out the part of the company’s basic income tax liability
that was attributable to its shareholders, have regard to the
company’s accounting records.
Example: The following apply to a life insurance company that satisfies the
residency requirement for an income year:
(a) the company has a tax offset of $60,000 under section 205-70
(the franking deficit offset) for that year;
(b) the company’s basic income tax liability for that year would be
$100,000 if the franking deficit offset were disregarded;
(c) 20% of the $100,000 is attributable to the company’s
shareholders (the shareholders’ part).
As a result of applying $20,000 of the franking deficit offset to reduce
the shareholders’ part to nil, the company’s basic income tax liability
becomes $80,000. The remaining $40,000 of the offset will be
included in a franking deficit tax offset for the next income year for
which the company satisfies the residency requirement.

219-75 Working out franking credits and franking debits where a
tax offset under section 205-70 is applied
Revised shareholders’ ratio—modification of section 219-50
(1) Subsection (2) applies to a *life insurance company if a *tax offset
under section 205-70 is applied to work out the company’s
*income tax liability for an income year.
Note:

This means subsection (2) applies if the tax offset is applied to reduce
the part of the company’s basic income tax liability mentioned in
subsection 219-70(1) in relation to the income year.

(2) For the purposes of working out the amount of a *franking credit or

Section 219-75
(other than a franking credit covered by item 1 of the table in
section 219-15), section 219-50 has effect as if:
(a) steps 1 and 2 of the method statement in section 219-50 were
omitted; and
(b) the reference in step 3 of that method statement to the
*shareholders’ ratio were a reference to the revised
shareholders’ ratio worked out as follows:
Method statement
Step 1.

Work out the remainder (if any) of the part of the
company’s basic income tax liability mentioned in
subsection 219-70(1) after the *tax offset is applied to
reduce that part.
Note:

Step 2.

The part mentioned in that subsection is the part of an
amount of the company’s income tax liability for the
income year that is attributable to its shareholders.

Divide the step 1 result by the company’s total *income
tax liability for the income year (after applying the *tax
offset).
The result (which can be nil) is the company’s revised
shareholders’ ratio for the income year.

Example: For the 2002-2003 income year X Co (which is a life insurance
company) has a tax offset of $68,000 under section 205-70. Its income
tax liability for that year would have been $400,000 on the assessment
day (1 February 2004) if the tax offset were disregarded. Of that
liability, $80,000 is attributable to the shareholders. The step 1 result
is therefore $12,000 ($80,000 minus $68,000).
X Co’s income tax liability after applying the tax offset is $332,000
($400,000 minus $68,000). The revised shareholders’ ratio is therefore
3/83 ($12,000 divided by $332,000).
For that income year, the company paid $249,000 of PAYG
instalments before the assessment day and $83,000 of income tax one
month after that day.

Section 219-75
On the assessment day, a franking credit of $9,000 arises under item 2
of the table in section 219-15 ($249,000 multiplied by 3/83). On the
day the additional amount of tax is paid, another franking credit of
$3,000 arises under item 4 of that table ($83,000 multiplied by 3/83).

Adjustment resulting from amended assessment—modification of
section 219-55
(3) Subsection (4) applies to a *life insurance company if:
(a) the assessment of the company’s *income tax liability for an
income year (the previous assessment) is amended; and
(b) at least one of the following applies:
(i) a *tax offset under section 205-70 is applied in making
that amended assessment;
(ii) a tax offset under section 205-70 was applied in making
the previous assessment.
(4) Section 219-55 has effect in relation to the company as if:
(a) if subparagraph (3)(b)(i) of this section applies—a reference
in that section to the new ratio were a reference to the revised
shareholders’ ratio that is based on the amended assessment;
and
(b) if subparagraph (3)(b)(ii) of this section applies—the
reference in paragraph (1)(b) of that section to the
*shareholders’ ratio used previously were a reference to the
revised shareholders’ ratio that is based on the previous
assessment.
Example: Continuing the example in subsection (2), the assessment of X Co for
the 2002-2003 income year is amended on 31 March 2004. Under the
amended assessment, X Co’s income tax liability would be $300,000
if the tax offset were disregarded.
Of that liability, $60,000 is attributable to the shareholders. That
amount is reduced by the tax offset of $68,000 to nil.
X Co’s liability to pay income tax is therefore reduced to $240,000
($300,000 minus $60,000) and it will receive a refund of $92,000
($332,000 minus $240,000). As the revised shareholders’ ratio has
become nil, no franking debit arises from the refund.

Section 219-75
The franking credits that previously arose from the payments of
PAYG instalments and income tax would not have arisen if the new
revised shareholders’ ratio had been used. Section 219-55 (as applied
by subsection (4) of this section) therefore operates to create an
adjustment to cancel those franking credits. The adjustment is a
franking debit of $12,000 that arises on the day of the amendment of
the assessment.

(b) the choice is revoked or cancelled at a time (the end time);
and
(c) immediately before the end time the company is a foreign
resident.

(3) If the company’s *franking account was in *deficit immediately
before the end time, subsection 205-45(3) applies in relation to the

if the entity ceases to be a franking entity and had a franking deficit
immediately before ceasing to be a franking entity.

NZ recipient company’s franking account after conditions are met
(5) If, apart from paragraph (a), a *franking credit or *franking debit
would arise in the franking donor company’s *franking account at a
time (the accounting time) that is a time when all the conditions in
subsection (1) are met but after the first time at which all those
conditions are met in relation to the franking donor company:
(a) the credit or debit does not arise in the franking donor
company’s franking account; and
(b) a credit or debit of the same amount arises at the accounting
time in the NZ recipient company’s franking account instead.

make the contributor jointly or severally liable for the
unpaid amount.
(4) The joint and several liability of a particular contributor becomes
due and payable by the contributor 14 days after the Commissioner
gives it written notice of the liability.
Note 1:

Two or more contributors will have different due and payable dates
for the same liability if the Commissioner gives them notice of their
liability on different days.

Note 2:

This section does not affect the time at which the liability for the
unpaid amount arose for, or became due and payable by, the defaulter.

(5) If:
(a) the unpaid amount (the first interest amount) is *general
interest charge for a day in relation to another unpaid amount
(the primary liability) that consists of *franking deficit tax or
*over-franking tax; and
(b) on a day the Commissioner gives a particular contributor
written notice under subsection (4) of the contributor’s
liability for the first interest amount; and
(c) general interest charge arises:
(i) for a day (the later day) after the days mentioned in
paragraphs (a) and (b); and
(ii) in relation to the primary liability; and
(d) the general interest charge for the later day has not been paid
or otherwise discharged in full by the time it became due and
payable;
the Commissioner is taken to have given the contributor written
notice under subsection (4) of the general interest charge for the
later day on that later day.

230-1 What this Division is about
This Division is about the tax treatment of gains and losses from
your financial arrangements.
You recognise the gains and losses, as appropriate, over the life of
a financial arrangement and ignore distinctions between income
and capital unless specific rules apply.
If it is sufficiently certain that you will make a gain or loss, you use
a compounding accruals method to recognise the gain or loss.

Otherwise you use a realisation method. Instead of either, you may
be able to choose to use a fair value or hedging method or to rely
on your financial reports. You may also be able to choose to
recognise foreign exchange gains and losses using a retranslation
method.

230-5 Scope of this Division
(1) You have a financial arrangement if you have one or more cash
settlable legal or equitable rights and/or obligations to receive or
provide a financial benefit.
(2) This Division does not apply to all financial arrangements. The
main exceptions are if:
(a) you are:
(i) an individual; or
(ii) a superannuation entity or fund, managed investment
scheme or an entity substantially similar to a managed
investment scheme under foreign law with assets of less
than $100 million; or
(iii) an ADI, securitisation vehicle or other financial sector
entity with an aggregated turnover of less than $20
million; or
(iv) another entity with an aggregated turnover of less than
$100 million, financial assets of less than $100 million
and assets of less than $300 million;
and either:
(iva) the arrangement is to end not more than 12 months after
you start to have it; or
(v) the arrangement is not a qualifying security; or
(b) the arrangement is a financial arrangement under
section 230-50 (equity interests etc.) and neither a fair value
election, a hedging financial arrangement election nor an
election to rely on financial reports applies to the
arrangement.

Objects
230-10 Objects of this Division
The objects of this Division are:
(a) to minimise the extent to which the tax treatment of gains
and losses from your *financial arrangements distorts, by
providing inappropriate impediments and stimulation, your
trading, financing and investment decisions and your risk
taking and risk management; and
(b) to do so by aligning more closely the tax and commercial
recognition of gains and losses from your financial
arrangements in the following ways:
(i) by allocating the gains and losses to income years
throughout the life of your financial arrangements on a
reasonable basis;
(ii) by generally recognising gains and losses on revenue
rather than capital account; and
(c) to appropriately take account of, and minimise, your
compliance costs.

Tax treatment of gains and losses from financial arrangements
230-15 Gains are assessable and losses deductible
Gains
(1) Your assessable income includes a gain you make from a *financial
arrangement.
Note:

This Division does not apply to gains that are subject to exceptions
under Subdivision 230-H.

Losses
(2) You can deduct a loss you make from a *financial arrangement, but
only to the extent that:

(a) you make it in gaining or producing your assessable income;
or
(b) you necessarily make it in carrying on a *business for the
purpose of gaining or producing your assessable income.
Note:

This Division does not apply to losses that are subject to exceptions
under Subdivision 230-H.

(3) You can also deduct a loss you make from a *financial arrangement
if:
(a) you are an *Australian entity; and
(b) you make the loss in deriving income from a foreign source;
and
(c) the income is *non-assessable non-exempt income under
section 768-5, or section 23AI or 23AK of the Income Tax
Assessment Act 1936; and
(d) the loss is, in whole or in part, a cost that is covered by
paragraph 820-40(1)(a).
You can deduct the loss only to the extent to which it is a cost that
is covered by paragraph 820-40(1)(a).
Note:

This Division does not apply to losses that are subject to exceptions
under Subdivision 230-H.

(4) If the *financial arrangement is a *debt interest, the loss is not
prevented from being deductible for an income year under
subsection (2) merely because of either or both of the following:
(a) one or more of the *financial benefits that are taken into
account in working out the amount of the loss are *contingent
on aspects of the economic performance (whether past,
current or future) of:
(i) you or a part of your activities; or
(ii) a *connected entity of yours or a part of the activities of
a connected entity of yours;
(b) one or more of the financial benefits that are taken into
account in working out the amount of the loss secure a
permanent or enduring benefit for you or a connected entity
of yours.

Section 230-15
(4A) A *dividend on a *debt interest is a loss you can deduct to the
extent to which it would have been a deductible loss under
subsection (2) if:
(a) the payment of the amount of the dividend were the incurring
of a liability to pay the same amount as interest; and
(b) that interest were incurred in respect of the finance raised by
you and in respect of which the dividend was paid or
provided; and
(c) the debt interest retained its character as a debt interest for
the purposes of subsection (4).
(5) Subject to subsection (6), subsection (4) does not apply to the loss
to the extent to which the annually compounded internal rate of
return on the *debt interest exceeds the *benchmark rate of return
for the debt interest increased by 150 basis points.
(6) If:
(a) regulations made for the purposes of subsection 25-85(6)
provide that a specified number of basis points is to apply for
the purposes of applying subsection 25-85(5) in particular
circumstances; and
(b) those circumstances exist in relation to the *debt interest;
subsection (5) applies as if the reference in that subsection to 150
basis points were a reference to the number of basis points
specified in the regulations.
Division does not affect foreign residence rules
(7) Nothing in this Division affects the operation of the provisions of
Division 6 that provide for the significance of foreign residence for
the assessability of ordinary and statutory income.
Note 1:

Gains that you make under this Division may be ordinary or statutory
income for the purposes of Division 6.

Note 2:

For the effect of a change of residence during an income year, see
sections 230-485 and 230-490.

Financial arrangement concept
230-45 Financial arrangement
(1) You have a financial arrangement if you have, under an
*arrangement:
(a) a *cash settlable legal or equitable right to receive a *financial
benefit; or
(b) a cash settlable legal or equitable obligation to provide a
financial benefit; or
(c) a combination of one or more such rights and/or one or more
such obligations;
unless:
(d) you also have under the arrangement one or more legal or
equitable rights to receive something and/or one or more
legal or equitable obligations to provide something; and
(e) for one or more of the rights and/or obligations covered by
paragraph (d):
(i) the thing that you have the right to receive, or the
obligation to provide, is not a financial benefit; or
(ii) the right or obligation is not cash settlable; and
(f) the one or more rights and/or obligations covered by
paragraph (e) are not insignificant in comparison with the
right, obligation or combination covered by paragraph (a), (b)
or (c).
The right, obligation or combination covered by paragraph (a), (b)
or (c) constitutes the financial arrangement.
Note 1:

Whether your rights and/or obligations under an arrangement
constitute a financial arrangement can change over time depending on
changes either to the terms of the arrangement or external
circumstances (such as particular rights or obligations under the
arrangement being satisfied by the parties). For example, a contract
may provide for the transfer of a boat in 6 months time and payment
of the contract price at the end of 2 years. Until the boat is delivered,

The operative provisions of this Division do not apply to all financial
arrangements, and only apply partially to some: see the exceptions in
Subdivision 230-H.

Note 3:

There are some rules in this Division that tell you what happens if an
arrangement ceases to be a financial arrangement (see
Subdivision 230-G and section 230-505).

(2) A right you have to receive, or an obligation you have to provide, a
*financial benefit is cash settlable if, and only if:
(a) the benefit is money or a *money equivalent; or
(b) in the case of a right—you intend to satisfy or settle it by
receiving money or a money equivalent or by starting to
have, or ceasing to have, another *financial arrangement; or
(c) in the case of an obligation—you intend to satisfy or settle it
by providing money or a money equivalent or by starting to
have, or ceasing to have, another financial arrangement; or
(d) you have a practice of satisfying or settling similar rights or
obligations as mentioned in paragraph (b) or (c) (whether or
not you intend to satisfy or settle the right or obligation in
that way); or
(e) you deal with the right or obligation, or with similar rights or
obligations, in order to generate a profit from short-term

Section 230-50
A reference in paragraph (b) or (c) to a financial arrangement does
not include a reference to something that is a financial arrangement
under section 230-50.
Note:

Examples of dealing of the kind covered by paragraph (e) are:
(a) dealing with the right or obligation, or similar rights or
obligations, on a frequent basis, a short-term basis or on a
frequent and short-term basis; and
(b) acquiring the right or obligation, or similar rights or obligations,
and managing the resulting risk by entering into offsetting
arrangements that provide a profit margin.

(3) You satisfy this subsection if:
(a) the *financial benefit is readily convertible into money or a
*money equivalent; and
(b) there is a market for the financial benefit that has a high
degree of liquidity; and
(c) subsection (4) or (5) is satisfied.
(4) This subsection is satisfied if, for the recipient of the *financial
benefit, the amount of the money or *money equivalent referred to
in paragraph (3)(a) is not subject to a substantial risk of substantial
decrease in value.
(5) This subsection is satisfied if your purpose, or one of your
purposes, for entering into the arrangement under which you are to
receive or provide the *financial benefit, is to receive or deliver the
financial benefit:
(a) to raise or provide finance; or
(b) if paragraph (a) does not apply—so that it may be converted
or liquidated into money or a money equivalent (other than as
part of your expected purchase, sale or usage requirements).

230-50 Financial arrangement (equity interest or right or obligation
in relation to equity interest)
(1) You also have a financial arrangement if you have an *equity
interest. The equity interest constitutes the financial arrangement.

(a) you have, under an *arrangement:
(i) a legal or equitable right to receive something that is a
financial arrangement under this section; or
(ii) a legal or equitable obligation to provide something that

Section 230-55
Matters relevant to determining what rights and/or obligations
constitute particular arrangements
(4) For the purposes of this Division, whether a number of rights
and/or obligations are themselves an *arrangement or are 2 or more
separate arrangements is a question of fact and degree that you
determine having regard to the following:
(a) the nature of the rights and/or obligations;
(b) their terms and conditions (including those relating to any
payment or other consideration for them);
(c) the circumstances surrounding their creation and their
proposed exercise or performance (including what can
reasonably be seen as the purposes of one or more of the
entities involved);
(d) whether they can be dealt with separately or must be dealt
with together;
(e) normal commercial understandings and practices in relation
to them (including whether they are regarded commercially
as separate things or as a group or series that forms a whole);
(f) the objects of this Division.
In applying this subsection, have regard to the matters referred to
in paragraphs (a) to (f) both in relation to the rights and/or
obligations separately and in relation to the rights and/or
obligations in combination with each other.
Example 1: Your rights and obligations under a typical convertible note, including
the right to convert the note into a share or shares, would constitute
one arrangement.
Example 2: Your rights and obligations under a typical price-linked or
index-linked bond would constitute one arrangement.
Note 1:

If you raised funds by means of a contract that you would not have
entered into without entering into another contract, and neither
contract could be assigned to a third party without the other also being
assigned, this would tend to indicate that your rights and obligations
under the 2 contracts together constitute one arrangement.

Note 2:

If the commercial effect of your individual rights and/or obligations in
a group or series cannot be understood without reference to the group
or series as a whole, this would tend to indicate that all of your rights

General rules
230-60 When financial benefit provided or received under financial
arrangement
Financial benefit provided under financial arrangement
(1) You are taken, for the purposes of this Division, to have (or to have
had) an obligation to provide a *financial benefit under a *financial
arrangement if:
(a) you have (or had) an obligation to provide the financial
benefit in relation to the arrangement; and
(b) the financial benefit would not otherwise be treated as one
that you have (or had) an obligation to provide under the
arrangement; and
(c) the financial benefit plays an integral role in determining:
(i) whether you make a gain or loss from the arrangement;
or
(ii) the amount of such a gain or loss.
Paragraph (a) applies even if the entity to which you provide the
financial benefit is not a party to the arrangement.
Note:

This means that the financial benefits you provide to acquire the
financial arrangement (whether to the issuer, a previous holder or a
third party) are taken to be financial benefits you provide under the
arrangement. The financial benefits you provide may include, for
example, fees paid or the forgoing of rights to receive a financial
benefit.

Financial benefit received under financial arrangement
(2) You are taken, for the purposes of this Division, to have (or to have
had) a right to receive a *financial benefit under a *financial
arrangement if:

(a) a *financial benefit plays the integral role mentioned in
paragraph 230-60(1)(c) or (2)(c) in relation to a *financial
arrangement; and
(b) either or both of the following apply:
(i) the financial benefit plays that role in relation to one or
more other financial arrangements;
(ii) the financial benefit is provided or received for one or
more other things that are not financial arrangements.
(2) For the purposes of this Division, determine the amount of the

financial benefit, on a reasonable basis, between:
(a) that financial arrangement; and
(b) each other financial arrangement (if any) in relation to which
the benefit plays that role; and

230-90 What this Subdivision is about
This Subdivision applies the accruals method to determine the
amount and timing of gains and losses from a financial
arrangement if they are sufficiently certain for such accrual to be
done.
This Subdivision applies the realisation method to determine the
amount and timing of gains and losses if they are not sufficiently
certain to be dealt with under the accruals method.
If the accruals method is applied to a gain or loss on the basis of an
estimate of a financial benefit and the benefit when received or
provided is more or less than the estimate, a balancing adjustment
is made to correct for the underestimate or overestimate.
If the accruals method is being applied to gains and losses from the
arrangement and there is a material change to the arrangement, or
the circumstances in which it operates, a reassessment is made of
whether the accruals method or the realisation method should
apply to gains and losses from the arrangement.
A change in circumstances may also cause a re-estimation of gains
and losses that the accruals method is being applied to.

into account, under subsection 230-105(1), in working out, at
the time when you started to have the arrangement, the
amount of a sufficiently certain overall gain or loss from the
*financial arrangement to which the accruals method applies;
and
(c) disregard any financial benefit (or that part of any financial
benefit) that has already been taken into account in working
out the amount of a sufficiently certain gain or loss from the

Note:

Sections 230-70 and 230-75 allow you to apportion financial benefits
provided and financial benefits received in working out the amount of
a gain or loss.

230-115 Sufficiently certain financial benefits
(1) In deciding for the purposes of this Subdivision whether it is
sufficiently certain at a particular time that you make, or will make,
a gain or loss from a *financial arrangement:
(a) have regard only to:
(i) *financial benefits that you are sufficiently certain to
receive; and
(ii) financial benefits that you are sufficiently certain to
provide; and
(b) have regard to those financial benefits only to the extent that
the amount or value of the benefits is, at that time, fixed or
determinable with reasonable accuracy.
Note:

The particular time may be the time at which you start to have the
arrangement.

(2) A *financial benefit that you are to receive or provide is to be
treated as one that you are sufficiently certain to receive or to
provide only if:
(a) it is reasonably expected that you will receive or provide the
financial benefit (assuming that you will continue to have the
*financial arrangement for the rest of its life); and
(b) at least some of the amount or value of the benefit is, at that
time, fixed or determinable with reasonable accuracy.
(3) In applying subsection (2) to the *financial benefit:
(a) you must have regard to:
(i) the terms and conditions of the *financial arrangement;
and
(ii) accepted pricing and valuation techniques; and
(iii) the economic or commercial substance and effect of the
arrangement; and
(iv) the contingencies that attach to the other financial
benefits that are to be provided or received under the
arrangement; and
(b) you must treat the financial benefit as if it were not
contingent if it is appropriate to do so having regard to the
contingencies that attach to the other financial benefits that
are to be received or provided under the arrangement.
(4) In applying paragraph (2)(b) at a particular time (the reference
time) to a *financial benefit that depends on a variable that is based
on:
(a) an interest rate; or
(b) a rate that solely or primarily reflects the time value of
money; or
(c) a rate that solely or primarily reflects a consumer price index;
or
(d) a rate that solely or primarily reflects an index prescribed by
the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph;
you must assume that that variable will continue to have the value
it has at the reference time.

(5) Despite subsection (4), in applying paragraph (2)(b) at a particular
time to a *financial benefit that depends on a rate of change to a
variable that is based on:
(a) a rate that solely or primarily reflects a consumer price index;
or
(b) a rate that solely or primarily reflects an index prescribed by
the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph;
you must assume that the rate of change to that variable will
continue to be the rate of change that is current at that time.
(6) If subsection (4) or (5) applies to a gain or loss and you are
determining the amount of the gain or loss at a particular time, you
must also assume that that variable will continue to have the value
that it has at that time.
(7) Subsections (4) and (5) do not limit paragraph (2)(b).
(8) If all of the *financial benefits provided and received under the
*financial arrangement are denominated in a particular *foreign
currency, those financial benefits are not to be translated into:
(a) your *applicable functional currency; or
(b) if you do not have an applicable functional currency—
Australian currency;
for the purposes of applying subsection (2) to the arrangement.
(9) To avoid doubt:
(a) a *financial benefit that you have already provided at a
particular time is taken to be one that it is, at that time, a
financial benefit that you are sufficiently certain to provide;
and
(b) a financial benefit that you have already received at a
particular time is taken to be one that it is, at that time, a
financial benefit that you are sufficiently certain to receive.

230-120 Financial arrangements with notional principal
(1) This section applies to a *financial arrangement that you have if, in
substance or effect, and having regard to the pricing, terms and
conditions of the arrangement:
(a) the arrangement consists of these things:
(i) a leg, the *financial benefits to be provided or received
in respect of which are calculated by reference to, or are
reasonably related to, a notional principal;
(ii) another leg, the financial benefits to be provided or
received in respect of which also are calculated by
reference to, or are reasonably related to, a notional
principal;
(iii) if the arrangement includes one or more other things—
those things; and
(b) when you start to have the arrangement, the value of the
notional principal in relation to one leg is equal to the value
of the notional principal in relation to the other leg; and
(c) all or part of the notional principal in relation to each leg is
provided or received at a time, regardless of whether that
time is different in relation to each leg.
Example: A swap contract.

(2) To avoid doubt, the *financial benefits mentioned in
subparagraphs (1)(a)(i) and (ii), and the notional principal in
relation to each leg, need not actually be provided or received.
(3) In applying this Subdivision to the *financial arrangement:
(a) work out the *financial benefits from the arrangement as
follows:
(i) work out the financial benefits from each thing of which
the arrangement consists separately from the financial
benefits from each other thing of which the arrangement
consists;
(ii) ensure that results under subparagraph (i) are consistent

gain or loss is to be spread
Period over which overall gain or loss is to be spread
(1) If you have a sufficiently certain overall gain or loss from a
*financial arrangement under subsection 230-105(1), the period
over which the gain or loss is to be spread is the period that:
(a) starts when you start to have the arrangement; and
(b) ends when you will cease to have the arrangement.
In applying paragraph (b), you must assume that you will continue
to have the arrangement for the rest of its life.
Period over which particular gain or loss is to be spread
(3) If you have a sufficiently certain gain or loss from a *financial
arrangement under subsection 230-110(1), the period over which
the gain or loss is to be spread is the period to which the gain or
loss relates. Have regard to the pricing, terms and conditions of the
arrangement in working out the period to which the gain or loss
relates. This subsection has effect subject to subsections (4) and
(5).
(4) The start of the period over which a gain or loss to which
subsection (3) applies is to be spread must:
(a) not start earlier than the time when you start to have the
*financial arrangement; and
(b) other than in the case of a gain or loss to which
subsection 230-100(3A) or subsection (4A) of this section

sufficiently certain (whether or not the gain or loss was
sufficiently certain before the reassessment); and
(d) there is a reversal of the impairment loss (within the meaning
of the accounting principles) that resulted from the
impairment; and
(e) because of the reversal, you make a reassessment under
section 230-185 in relation to the arrangement; and

the gain or loss is to be spread in accordance with paragraph (2)(a).
Intervals to which parts of gain or loss allocated
(4) The intervals to which parts of the gain or loss are allocated must:
(a) not exceed 12 months; and
(b) all be of the same length.
Paragraph (b) does not apply to the first and last intervals. These
may be shorter than the other intervals.
Fixing of amount and rate for interval
(5) For each interval:
(a) determine a rate of return; and
(b) determine an amount to which you apply the rate of return.
(6) For the purposes of paragraph (5)(b), in determining the amount to
which you apply the rate of return for an interval, have regard to:
(a) the amount or value; and
(b) the timing;
of *financial benefits that are to be taken into account in working
out the amount of the gain or loss, and were provided or received
by you during the interval.
(6A) However, if there is only one *financial benefit that is to be taken
into account in working out the amount of the gain or loss, then,
for the purposes of paragraph (5)(b), in determining the amount to
which you apply the rate of return, have regard to a notional
principal:
(a) by reference to which the financial benefit is calculated; or
(b) which is reasonably related to the financial benefit.

(b) you start to have the financial arrangement in that income
year or a later income year; and
(c) the financial arrangement is part of a portfolio of similar
financial arrangements; and
(d) a gain or loss to which subsection 230-130(3) applies arises
in part from a premium or discount in starting to have the

the amount of the gain or loss on the portfolio.
(2) For the purposes of this Division, split the gain or loss mentioned
in paragraph (1)(d) as follows:

it as a gain or loss from the *financial arrangement (the
premium/discount gain or loss) to which
subsection 230-130(3) applies;

The separate gain or loss mentioned in paragraph (b) may itself be
split under subsection 230-160(2) (portfolio fees gain or loss).

Determination of period for premium/discount gain or loss

mentioned in paragraph 230-150(1)(a); and
(b) the basis on which you determine the period is set and
recorded before you start to have the *financial arrangement;

When re-estimation necessary
(1) You re-estimate a gain or loss from a *financial arrangement under
subsection (5) if:
(a) the accruals method applies to the gain or loss; and
(b) circumstances arise that materially affect:
(i) the amount or value; or
(ii) the timing;
of *financial benefits that were taken into account in working

practicable after you become aware of the circumstances referred
to in paragraph (1)(b), if subsection (1) applies.
(3) Without limiting subsection (1), the following are circumstances of
the kind referred to in paragraph (1)(b):
(a) a material change in market conditions that are relevant to the
amount or value of the *financial benefits to be received or
provided under the *financial arrangement;
(b) cash flows that were previously estimated becoming known
and the difference between the cash flows that become
known and the cash flows that were previously estimates is
not insignificant;
(c) a right to, or a part of a right to, a financial benefit under the
arrangement is written off as a bad debt;
(d) you have made a reassessment under section 230-185 in
relation to gains or losses under the arrangement and you
have determined on the reassessment under that section that
the accruals method should continue to apply to those gains
or losses.

(3A) You also re-estimate a gain or loss from a *financial arrangement
under subsection (5) if:
(a) the gain or loss is spread using the method referred to in
paragraph 230-135(2)(b) in accordance with section 230-140
(effective interest method); and
(b) you recalculate the effective interest rate in accordance with
that method; and
(c) the terms and conditions of the arrangement provide for reset
dates to occur no more than 12 months apart; and
(d) the maximum life of the arrangement (as determined under
the terms and conditions of the arrangement) is more than 12
months.
(3B) You must re-estimate the gain or loss at the relevant reset date if
subsection (3A) applies.
(4) You do not re-estimate the gain or loss from a *financial
arrangement under subsection (5) merely because of a change in
the credit rating, or the creditworthiness, of a party or parties to the
arrangement.
Nature of re-estimation
(5) Making a re-estimation in relation to a gain or loss under this
subsection involves:
(a) a fresh determination of the amount of the gain or loss; and
(b) a reapplication of the accruals method to the redetermined
gain or loss to make a fresh allocation of the part of the
redetermined gain or loss that has not already been allocated
to intervals ending before the re-estimation is made to
intervals ending after the re-estimation is made.
Basis for re-estimation

subsection (5) on these bases:
(a) if you satisfy subsection (7) in relation to the *financial
arrangement—by maintaining the rate of return being used

discounted at the maintained rate of return;
(b) in any case—by adjusting the rate of return and maintaining
the amount to which the adjusted rate of return is to be

Note:

The amount referred to in paragraph (b) is the amount to which the
previous rate of return was being applied immediately before the

(7) You satisfy this subsection in relation to a *financial arrangement if
every re-estimation you make under subsection (5) in relation to a
gain or loss from the arrangement is made in accordance with:
(a) financial reports of the kind referred to in
paragraph 230-395(2)(a) that are audited as referred to in

Subdivision 230-F (reliance on financial reports method) is to
apply to a particular financial arrangement); and
(b) *accounting standard AASB 139 (or another accounting
standard prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this
paragraph).

230-192 Re-estimation—impairments and reversals
(1) This section applies if the re-estimation mentioned in
section 230-190 arises because of:
(a) an impairment (within the meaning of the *accounting
principles) of:
(i) the *financial arrangement; or
(ii) a financial asset or financial liability that forms part of
the arrangement; or
(b) a reversal of an impairment loss (within the meaning of the
accounting principles) that resulted from such an impairment.

(i) resulted from the impairment; and
(ii) you could have deducted apart from

(b) the loss you make under paragraph 230-195(1)(b) or (c)
relates to you writing off, as a bad debt, a right to receive a

(3) The balancing adjustment to be made under paragraph (1)(b), to
the extent that it relates to the writing off of the bad debt, must not
exceed so much of the gain in relation to the *financial
arrangement as:
(a) has been assessed under this Division; and
(b) is reasonably attributable to the *financial benefit (or the part
of the financial benefit).
(4) Subsection (5) applies if:
(a) the re-estimation is made wholly or partly on the basis that
you have written off, as a bad debt, a right to receive a
*financial benefit; and
(b) the right is one that you bought in the ordinary course of your

(5) The balancing adjustment to be made under paragraph (1)(b), to
the extent that it relates to the writing off of the bad debt, must not
exceed the value of the *financial benefit you provided to acquire
the right to the financial benefit (or the part of the financial

(6) For the purposes of this Act, a deduction for the balancing
adjustment referred to in subsection (3) is to be treated as a
deduction of a bad debt.
Note:

Various provisions in this Act and the Income Tax Assessment Act
1936 restrict the availability of deductions for bad debts and make
provision in relation to the recoupment of amounts in relation to bad
debts that have been written off. These provisions are set out in

Section 230-200
(b) a balancing adjustment is made in relation to the arrangement
under Subdivision 230-G because you transfer to another
entity:
(i) a proportionate share of all of your rights and/or
obligations under the arrangement; or
(ii) a right or obligation that you have under the
arrangement to a specifically identified *financial
benefit; or
(iii) a proportionate share of a right or obligation that you
have under the arrangement to a specifically identified
financial benefit.
You must re-estimate the gain or loss as soon as reasonably
practicable after the transfer occurs.
Nature of re-estimation
(2) Making a re-estimation in relation to a gain or loss under this
subsection involves:
(a) a fresh determination of the amount of the gain or loss
disregarding:
(i) *financial benefits; and
(ii) amounts of the gain or loss that have already been
allocated to intervals ending before the re-estimation is
made;
to the extent to which they are reasonably attributable to the
proportionate share, or the right or obligation, referred to in
paragraph (1)(b); and
(b) a reapplication of the accruals method to the redetermined
gain or loss to make a fresh allocation of the part of that gain
or loss that has not already been allocated to intervals ending
before the re-estimation is made to intervals ending after the
re-estimation is made.
Basis for re-estimation

(c) next, work out the gain or loss you make from the
arrangement for the second year in accordance with
section 230-280 (treating the second year as an income year);
(d) next, work out how much of the gain or loss mentioned in

are both losses—add them together to work out the loss
from the arrangement for the income year; or
(iii) if one of the amounts worked out under paragraphs (b)
and (d) is a loss and the other is a gain—subtract the
loss from the gain. If the result is positive, this is the
gain from the arrangement for the income year. If the
result is negative, this is the loss from the arrangement
for the income year.

audited, as referred to in paragraph 230-255(2)(b); and
(c) in relation to which you are required by:
(i) *accounting standard AASB 121 (or another accounting
standard prescribed by the regulations for the purposes
of this paragraph); or
(ii) if that standard does not apply to the preparation of the
financial report—a comparable accounting standard that

*foreign law;
to recognise, in the financial reports, amounts in profit or loss
(if any) that are attributable to changes in currency exchange
rates; and
(d) that you start to have in the income year in which you make
the election or in a later income year.
This subsection has effect subject to section 230-270.
Note:

The election also has consequences under Subdivision 775-F for
arrangements that are not Division 230 financial arrangements.

(2) If, but for this subsection, paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) would not be
satisfied in relation to a *financial arrangement because the
arrangement is an intra-group transaction for the purposes of:
(a) *accounting standard AASB 127 (or another accounting
standard prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this
paragraph); or
(b) if that standard does not apply to the preparation of the
financial report—a comparable accounting standard that
applies to the preparation of the financial report under a
*foreign law;
paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) are taken to be satisfied in relation to the
arrangement.
Note:

Financial arrangements between members of a consolidated group or
MEC group are not covered by this subsection because the single
entity rule in subsection 701-1(1) operates to treat them as not being
financial arrangements for the purposes of this Division.

230-295 Objects of this Subdivision
The objects of this Subdivision are:
(a) to facilitate the efficient management of financial risk by
reducing after-tax mismatches and better aligning tax
treatment where hedging takes place; and
(b) to minimise tax deferral and tax motivated practices
(including tax deferral arising from such practices as tax
advantaged selection from among possible hedges and
inappropriate selection of tax treatment).

230-300 Applying hedging financial arrangement method to gains
and losses
(1) If you have a *hedging financial arrangement to which a *hedging
financial arrangement election applies, the gain or loss you make
for an income year from the arrangement is worked out under this
section and section 230-310 instead of under Subdivision 230-B,
230-C, 230-D, 230-F or 230-G.
(2) Except where subsection (5) applies, the gain or loss you make
from the *hedging financial arrangement is equal to the overall
gain or loss you make from the arrangement.
(3) The gain or loss you make from the *hedging financial
arrangement is allocated over income years according to the
determination referred to in subsection 230-360(1).
Note 1:

The allocation is capable of extending to income years after you cease
to have the hedging financial arrangement (see
subsection 230-360(3)).

Note 2:

The determination must be included in the record made under
section 230-355.

(4) If the *hedging financial arrangement is a *foreign currency hedge
and is a *debt interest, split a gain or loss you make from the
arrangement as follows:
(a) to the extent to which the gain or loss represents a *currency
exchange rate effect attributable to the outstanding balance in

(b) to the extent that it does not represent that effect, treat it as a
separate gain or loss from the financial arrangement that is
allocated under Subdivision 230-B, 230-F or 230-G.
(5) If an event listed in the table in subsection 230-305(1) occurs:
(a) the gain or loss you make from the *hedging financial
arrangement is equal to any gain or loss that you would have
made:
(i) while the arrangement was hedging the *hedged item or
items; and
(ii) on ceasing to have the arrangement;
if you ceased to have the arrangement for its fair value at the
time of the event; and
(b) this Division further applies as if, just after the event, you
had acquired the arrangement for its fair value at the time of
the event.
Despite subsection (3), the gain or loss referred to in paragraph (a)
is allocated over income years according to the table.
(7) Subsection (8) applies if the *hedging financial arrangement:
(a) is a *financial arrangement under section 230-50 (equity
interests etc.); and
(b) is a *foreign currency hedge; and
(c) is one that you issue.
(8) Split a gain or loss you make from the arrangement as follows:
(a) to the extent to which the gain or loss represents a *currency
exchange rate effect, treat it as a separate gain or loss to
which subsections (1) and (2) apply;
(b) to the extent that it does not represent that effect, treat it as a
separate gain or loss from the financial arrangement to which
this Division does not apply.

230-360 Determining basis for allocating gain or loss
(1) A requirement of this section is that you must determine the basis
on which your gain or loss from the *hedging financial
arrangement is to be allocated to an income year, or over 2 or more
income years, for the purposes of this Division.
(2) It is also a requirement of this section that the basis that you
determine must:
(a) fairly and reasonably correspond with the basis on which
gains, losses or other amounts in relation to the *hedged item
or items are recognised or allocated under this Act; and
(b) be objective; and
(c) be sufficiently precise and detailed that, when your gain, loss
or other amount from the *hedged item or items is taken into
account for the purposes of this Act, the following will be
clear from the record made under section 230-355:
(i) the time at which the gain or loss from the *hedging
financial arrangement is to be taken into account for the
purposes of this Division;
(ii) the way in which that gain or loss will be dealt with
under section 230-310.
Note:

Paragraph (a) refers to an amount in relation to the hedged item or
items being recognised or allocated under this Act. This would include
an amount being allowed as a deduction or an amount being included
in assessable income. If the hedged item were an asset, an amount
referable to a part of the cost of the asset might, for example, be
allowed as a deduction for a particular income year.

(3) To avoid doubt, the income years over which your gain or loss is to
be allocated may include an income year that starts after you cease
to have the *hedging financial arrangement.

Section 230-365
230-365 Effectiveness of the hedge
The requirement of this section is that:
(a) hedging the risk must be expected to be effective (within the
meaning of the principles or standards referred to in
paragraph 230-315(2)(a)), for the period for which you
expect to have the *hedging financial arrangement, in
reducing your exposure to changes in the fair value of the
*hedged item or items or cash flows attributable to your
hedged risk; and
(b) the fair value of the hedged item or items or cash flows
relating to them and the fair value of the arrangement must
be able to be reliably measured; and
(c) you must assess the hedging of the risk by the arrangement:
(i) on a regular basis in accordance with the *accounting
principles; and
(ii) at least once in each 12 month period; and
(d) your assessment must be that the hedging of the risk will be
effective (within the meaning of the principles or standards
referred to in paragraph 230-315(2)(a)) in reducing your
exposure to changes in the fair value of the hedged item or
items or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk throughout
the remainder of the period for which you expect to have the
arrangement.

230-370 When election ceases to apply
(1) A *hedging financial arrangement election ceases to have effect
from the start of an income year if you cease to be eligible under
subsection 230-315(2) to make the election for that income year.
(2) Subsection (1) does not prevent you from making a new *hedging
financial arrangement election at a later time if you become, at that
later time, eligible under subsection 230-315(2) to make an
election for an income year.

(1) This section applies if a *hedging financial arrangement election
ceases to have effect under subsection 230-370(1).
(2) You are taken, for the purposes of this Division, to have:
(a) disposed of each *hedging financial arrangement to which the
election applies for its fair value immediately before the

Section 230-505
230-505 Financial arrangement as consideration for provision or
acquisition of a thing
(1) This section applies if you start or cease to have a *Division 230
financial arrangement as consideration for the provision or
acquisition of a thing.
(2) Work out the *market value of the thing at the time at which you
(in fact) provide or acquire it. For the purposes of applying this Act
to you, treat the amount:
(a) you obtain for providing the thing; or
(b) you provide for acquiring the thing;
as being that market value.
Note 1:

The amount may be relevant, for example, for the purposes of
applying the provisions of this Act dealing with capital gains, capital
allowances or trading stock to the thing.

Note 2:

This subsection does not affect the financial benefits received or
provided under the financial arrangement from you starting or ceasing
to have it (except in the circumstances described in Note 3). However:
(a) the market value of the thing will be, or form part of, those
financial benefits for the purposes of section 230-445; and
(b) in the case of a non arm’s length transaction, the amount of those
financial benefits may be affected by section 230-510.

Note 3:

If the thing is itself a Division 230 financial arrangement and
subsection (3) does not apply, this subsection will determine the
financial benefits received or provided under the financial
arrangement from you starting or ceasing to have it.

(3) Subsection (2) does not apply if:
(a) you start or cease to have the *financial arrangement as
mentioned in subsection (1) under an arrangement (the
starting or ceasing arrangement); and
(b) the thing is itself a *Division 230 financial arrangement; and
(c) the starting or ceasing arrangement is not itself a
Division 230 financial arrangement.
Example: An arrangement for exchanging a share subject to Subdivision 230-C
for another share subject to Subdivision 230-C, where the arrangement
itself is not a Division 230 financial arrangement.

(4) For the purposes of this section:
(a) treat yourself as providing a thing to another entity if:
(i) you have provided, or are to provide, the thing to the
other entity; or
(ii) you cease to have, have ceased to have or are to cease to
have, the thing; or
(iii) the other entity starts to have, has started having or is to
start to have, the thing; and
(b) treat yourself as acquiring a thing if:
(i) another entity has provided, or is to provide, the thing to
you; or
(ii) another entity ceases to have, has ceased to have or is to
cease to have, the thing; or
(iii) you start to have, have started to have or are to start to
have, the thing.
(5) For the purposes of this section, treat part of a *Division 230
financial arrangement as a Division 230 financial arrangement.
(6) Without limiting subsection (1), the thing provided, or the thing
acquired, need not be a tangible thing and may take the form of
services, conferring a right, incurring an obligation or
extinguishing or varying a right or obligation.
(7) To avoid doubt, this section applies even if your starting or ceasing
to have the *financial arrangement mentioned in subsection (1) is
only part of the consideration for the provision or acquisition of the
thing.
(8) For the purposes of this section, treat your starting or ceasing to
have the *financial arrangement mentioned in subsection (1) as
consideration for the provision or acquisition of the thing if that
starting or ceasing is, in substance or effect, done for the provision
or acquisition of the thing.
Example: Starting to have a financial arrangement in satisfaction of an
obligation, where the obligation itself was incurred as consideration
for the thing.

235-810 Object of this Subdivision
The object of this Subdivision is to ensure that, for most income
tax purposes, the consequences of ownership of an *instalment
trust asset flow to the entity that has the beneficial interest in the
asset, instead of to the trustee.

235-815 Application of Subdivision
(1) This Subdivision applies to:
(a) the entity that has the beneficial interest in an *instalment
trust asset as the beneficiary of an *instalment trust; and
(b) the trustee of the instalment trust.
(2) This Subdivision applies for the purposes of this Act, apart from:
(a) Part VA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (which is
about tax file numbers); and
(b) Subdivisions 12-E, 12-F and 12-H in Schedule 1 to the
Taxation Administration Act 1953 (which are about PAYG
withholding).
Joint investments
(3) This Subdivision applies in relation to 2 or more entities that hold
an interest in a trust as joint tenants, or as tenants in common, in
the same way it applies in relation to a single entity that holds such
an interest.
Note:

Each investor that is treated by this Subdivision as jointly owning an
instalment trust asset is treated for CGT purposes as owning a separate
asset: see section 108-7.

Section 235-820
235-820 Look-through treatment for instalment trusts
(1) If an entity (the investor) has a beneficial interest in an *instalment
trust asset under an *instalment trust, the asset is treated as being
the investor’s asset (instead of being an asset of the trust).
Example: A dividend in respect of the asset is paid to the trustee. It is treated
(but not for the purposes of the PAYG withholding provisions
mentioned in paragraph 235-815(2)(b)) as if it had been paid directly
to the investor.

(2) An act done in relation to an *instalment trust asset of an
*instalment trust by the trustee of the trust is treated as if the act
had been done by the investor (instead of by the trustee).
Example: A trustee disposes of the asset. Any capital gain or loss is made by the
investor, not by the trustee.

(3) The investor is treated as having the *instalment trust asset in the
same circumstances as the investor actually has the interest in the
*instalment trust.
(4) Without limiting subsection (3), the circumstances include:
(a) whether the interest is held on capital account or on revenue
account; and
(b) whether the interest is held as a joint tenant or tenant in
common.
(5) Any consequence arising under the *GST Act for the trustee of the
*instalment trust, as a result of anything done in relation to the
*instalment trust asset, is treated as if it had arisen for the investor
(instead of for the trustee), even if that consequence would not
have arisen had the thing been done by or to the investor.
Example: If the trustee has a net input tax credit under the GST Act, the investor
must apply the credit to reduce the investor’s cost base for the
instalment trust asset (even if the investor is not registered or required
to be registered for GST purposes): see section 103-30.

Section 235-830
(a) the trust is covered by section 235-830 (about instalment
trust arrangements) and satisfies the requirements in
section 235-835 (about requirements for underlying
investments to be listed or widely held); or
(b) the trust is covered by section 235-840 (about limited
recourse borrowings by *regulated superannuation funds).
(2) An instalment trust asset is an asset that is, or is part of, the
underlying investment of an *instalment trust (as mentioned in
section 235-830 or 235-840, as the case requires).

235-830 What trusts are covered—instalment trust arrangements
(1) This section covers a trust if, under an *arrangement:
(a) an entity (the investor) makes a *borrowing, or is provided
with credit; and
(b) to secure the borrowing or provision of credit, the trustee of
the trust acquires an asset or assets (the underlying
investment); and
(c) the investor has a beneficial interest in the underlying
investment as the sole beneficiary of the trust; and
(d) for a provision of credit—the credit was provided to the
investor to acquire the asset, or one of the assets, that
comprises the underlying investment; and
(e) the investor is entitled to the benefit of all income from the
underlying investment; and
(f) the investor is entitled to acquire legal ownership of the
underlying investment on discharging its obligations relating
to the borrowing or provision of credit.
Note:

For paragraph (c), the sole beneficiary of the trust may be 2 or more
entities that have an interest in the trust as joint tenants or tenants in
common: see subsection 235-815(3).

(2) However, this section does not cover a trust if the investor is a
trustee of a *regulated superannuation fund and the *arrangement
includes a *borrowing.

240-1 What this Division is about
For income tax purposes, some arrangements (such as hire
purchase agreements) are recharacterised as a sale of property,
combined with a loan, by the notional seller to the notional buyer,
to finance the purchase price.

240-3 How the recharacterisation affects the notional seller
Effect of notional sale
(1) The consideration for the notional sale is either the price stated as
the cost or value of the property or its arm’s length value. If the
notional seller is disposing of the property as trading stock, the

normal consequences of disposing of trading stock follow. In
particular, the notional seller will be assessed on the sale price.
(2) Where the property is not trading stock the notional seller’s
assessable income will include any profit made by the notional
seller on the notional sale or on the sale of the property after a
notional re-acquisition.
Effect of notional loan
(3) The notional seller’s assessable income will include notional
interest over the period of the loan.
Other effects
(4) These effects displace the income tax consequences that would
otherwise arise from the arrangement. For example, the actual
payments to the notional seller are not included in its assessable
income. Also, the notional seller loses the right to deduct amounts
under Division 40 (about capital allowances).

240-7 How the recharacterisation affects the notional buyer
Effect of notional purchase
(1) The cost of the acquisition is either the price stated as the cost or
value of the property or its arm’s length value. If the notional buyer
is acquiring the property as trading stock, the normal consequences
of acquiring trading stock follow. In particular, the notional buyer
can usually deduct the purchase price.
(2) If the property is not trading stock, the notional buyer may be able
to deduct amounts for the expenditure under Division 40 (about
capital allowances).
Effect of notional loan
(3) The notional buyer may be able to deduct notional interest
payments over the period of the loan.

Section 240-60

Operative provisions
240-60 Notional interest
(1) The *notional interest for an *arrangement payment period is
worked out as follows:
Calculating *notional interest
Step 1.

Add the *notional interest from previous *arrangement
payment periods to the notional loan principal.

Step 2.

Subtract any *arrangement payments that have already
been made or that are due but that have not been made.
The result is the outstanding notional loan principal as
at the start of the *arrangement payment period.

Step 3.

Work out the implicit interest rate for the *arrangement
payment period, taking into account the *arrangement
payments payable by the *notional buyer under the
*arrangement and any *termination amounts.

Step 4.

Multiply the outstanding notional loan principal by the
implicit interest rate. The result is the notional interest
for the *arrangement payment period.

(2) If only part of an *arrangement payment period occurs during an
income year, the *notional interest for that part of the arrangement
payment period is so much of the notional interest for that
arrangement payment period as may appropriately be related to
that income year in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.
(3) In calculating the implicit interest rate, if any of the relevant
amounts are not known at the start of the *arrangement, a
reasonable estimate of the amount is to be made and is to be used

for the purposes of calculating the implicit interest rate for each
income year of the *notional seller.
(4) If a reasonable estimate cannot be made at that time, an estimate of
the amount is to be made at the end of each income year of the
*notional seller for the purposes of calculating the implicit interest
rate for each income year of the notional seller.

240-65 Arrangement payments
An arrangement payment is an amount that the *notional buyer is
required to pay under the *arrangement but does not include:
(a) an amount in the nature of a penalty payable for failure to
make a payment on time; or
(b) a *termination amount.

240-70 Arrangement payment periods
(1) An *arrangement payment period is a period for which a payment
under the *arrangement is allocated or expressed to be payable.
(2) However, if a period exceeds 6 months, the period is not an
*arrangement payment period but each of the following parts of the
period is a separate arrangement payment period:
(a) the part of the period beginning at the start of that period and
ending 6 months later;
(b) each part of the period:
(i) beginning immediately after a part of the period that is
an arrangement payment period under paragraph (a) or
under a previous application of this paragraph; and
(ii) ending 6 months after the start of that later part or at the
end of the period, whichever first occurs.

240-80 What happens if the arrangement is extended or renewed
(1) This section sets out what happens if, after the end of the
*arrangement, the *notional buyer and *notional seller extend or
renew the *arrangement.
(2) This Division applies as if the original *arrangement has ended and
the extended arrangement or renewed arrangement is a separate
arrangement (the new arrangement).
(3) There is not, however, taken to be any disposal or acquisition as a
result of the original arrangement ending or of the new
arrangement starting and the *notional buyer does not cease to own
the property.
(4) Also, the notional loan principal for the new loan is:
(a) if the *arrangement as extended or renewed states an amount
as the cost or value of the property for the purposes of the
extension or renewal and the *notional seller and the
*notional buyer were dealing with each other at *arm’s length
in connection with the extension or renewal—the amount so
stated; or
(b) otherwise—the amount that could reasonably have been
expected to have been paid by the notional buyer for the
purchase of the property if:
(i) the notional seller had actually sold the property to the
notional buyer when the arrangement was extended or
renewed; and
(ii) the notional seller and notional buyer were dealing with
each other at arm’s length in connection with the sale.
(5) Subdivision 240-G applies to the notional loan for the original
arrangement. For that purpose, the notional loan principal for the
new arrangement is taken to be a *termination amount paid to the
*notional seller under the original arrangement.

Section 240-85
240-85 What happens if an amount is paid by or on behalf of the
notional buyer to acquire the property
If, at or after the end of the *arrangement, an amount is paid to the
*notional seller by, or on behalf of, the *notional buyer to acquire
the property, the following provisions have effect:
(a) the amount paid is not included in the notional seller’s
assessable income;
(b) the notional buyer cannot deduct the payment;
(c) the notional buyer is taken to continue to own the property;
(d) the transfer to the notional buyer of legal title to the property
is not taken to be a disposal of the property by the notional
seller.

240-90 What happens if the notional buyer ceases to have the right
to use the property
(1) This section applies if, at the end of the *arrangement:
(a) the arrangement is not extended or renewed in the way
mentioned in subsection 240-80(1); and
(b) no amount is paid to the *notional seller by, or on behalf of,
the *notional buyer to acquire the property; and
(c) the property is not lost or destroyed.
(2) The property is taken to have been disposed of by the *notional
buyer by way of sale back to the *notional seller, and to have been
acquired by the *notional seller, at the end of the *arrangement.
(3) The consideration for the sale of the property by the *notional
buyer, and the cost of the acquisition of the property by the
*notional seller, are each taken to be equal to the *market value of
the property at the end of the *arrangement.
(4) Subsection (5) applies where the property is a *car and if it:

the *financial year in which that time occurred;
the cost of the car, for the purpose of working out its decline in
value for that person under Division 40, would have been limited
by section 40-230.
(5) Where an associate of the *notional buyer acquires the *car, the
*cost of the car for the purposes of the application of Division 40 to
the associate is taken to be whichever is the lesser of:
(a) the sum of:
(i) the amount that would have been the *adjustable value
of the car at that time for the purposes of the application
of that Division to the notional buyer if the notional
buyer were not taken under this Division to have
disposed of the car; and
(ii) any amount that is included in the notional buyer’s
assessable income under section 40-285 because the
notional buyer is taken to have disposed of the car; or
(b) the cost of the acquisition of the car by the associate.

Subdivision 240-H—Application of Division 16E to certain
arrangements
240-112 Division 16E applies to certain arrangements
(1) Division 16E of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936
applies in relation to an arrangement (the assignment
arrangement) between the notional seller and another person (the
holder) to transfer the right to payments (the Division 240
payments) under an arrangement that is treated as a sale and loan
by this Division (the sale and loan arrangement).
(2) In applying Division 16E, the following assumptions are to be
made:
(a) the assignment arrangement is the qualifying security;
(b) the notional seller is the issuer;
(c) the qualifying security is issued when the assignment
arrangement is entered into;
(d) the issue price is consideration provided to the notional seller
under the assignment arrangement;
(e) the Division 240 payments are payments made by the
notional seller under the assignment arrangement;
(f) no part of the payments represent periodic interest.
(3) This Subdivision does not apply if the assignment arrangement
gives rise to a termination of the sale and loan arrangement for the
purposes of this Division.
(4) To avoid doubt, Division 6A of Part III of the Income Tax
Assessment Act 1936 does not apply to an assignment arrangement
to which this Subdivision applies.

(1) This section sets out special modifications of the effect of this
Division that apply in relation to a *hire purchase agreement
unless:
(a) the notional buyer would have been the owner or the
*quasi-owner of the property if the *arrangement had been a
sale of the property; and

242-1 What this Division is about
A luxury car is one whose market value exceeds the car limit set
for a car’s capital allowance deductions by section 40-230.
If the lessor of a luxury car is tax exempt, or taxed at a lower rate
than the lessee, the lease could be structured to give both parties a
better after-tax outcome than if the lessee had bought the car. The
lessee could fully deduct the lease payments, thereby avoiding the
capital allowance limit for luxury cars, and the lessor would
receive higher lease payments.
This Division removes the tax benefit for the lessee by putting both
parties in the same position as if the lessor had sold the car to the
lessee and lent the lessee the purchase price.

Note:

This subsection prevents interest on the notional loan that this
Division creates being subject to withholding tax under Division 11A.

(3) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), the question whether an
agreement is a *short-term hire agreement is determined on the
basis that an employee or employer of an entity is an *associate of
the entity.
Note:

Under the definition of short-term hire agreement in
subsection 995-1(1), successive agreements for the hire of the same
asset to an entity or its associates are not short-term hire agreements if
they result in substantial continuity of hiring.

242-15 Notional sale and acquisition
(1) This Act has effect as if:
(a) the *car had been disposed of (the notional sale) by the lessor
to the lessee; and
(b) the car had been acquired by the lessee;
at the start of the term of the lease.
Note:

This Act will apply as it would have if the lessor had actually disposed
of the car to the lessee. For example, if the lessor had been deducting
an amount for the car’s decline in value, the notional disposal will
activate the balancing adjustment rules in Subdivision 40-D because
the lessor would be treated as no longer holding the car.

(2) This Act also has effect as if the lessee owns the *car until:
(a) the lease (not including any extension or renewal of the
lease) ends; or
(b) the lessee enters into a sublease of the car and this Division
applies to the car in relation to the sublease.
Note 1:

This means that the lessee (and not the lessor) may be able to deduct
amounts for the decline in value of the car under Division 40.

Note 2:

The lessee will be treated as continuing to own the car until the end of
any extension or renewal: see section 242-80.

(1) The consideration for the notional sale by the lessor, and the first
element of the *cost of the *car for the lessee, are the car’s *market
value at the start of the term of the lease.
(2) If:
(a) the lease is a sublease; and
(b) the lessee is one or more of the following:
(i) an *associate of the lessor;
(ii) an employer of the lessor;
(iii) an employee of the lessor;
the first element of the *cost of the *car to the lessee is the sum of:
(c) the amount that would have been the car’s *adjustable value
at the start of the term of the lease for the purposes of
applying this Act to the lessor if the lessor were not taken
under this Division to have disposed of the car; and
(d) any amount that is included in the lessor’s assessable income

lessor is treated as having disposed of the car.

made a loan (the notional loan) to the lessee:
(a) for a period equal to the term of the lease (not including the
term of any extension or renewal); and
(b) of an amount (the notional loan principal) equal to the
consideration for the notional sale of the *car less any amount
paid, or credited by the lessor as having been paid, by the
lessee to the lessor, at or before the start of the term of the
lease, for the first element of the *cost of the car to the lessee;

The lessor’s assessable income includes the interest on the notional
loan.
The lease payments to the lessor are non-assessable non-exempt
income.
Note:
If the consideration for a notional sale of a car exceeds the
adjustable value of the car to the lessor, the excess will be included in
the lessor’s assessable income under section 40-285.
There would be a similar result if the lessor is treated as having
reacquired the car and then sells the car for more than the cost of
reacquisition.

Accrual amounts
(1) The lessor’s assessable income for an income year includes:
(a) if a *luxury car lease payment period for the lease of a *car
occurs wholly during that income year—the amount (an
accrual amount) worked out under subsection (2) for that
luxury car lease payment period; and
(b) if part of a luxury car lease payment period for the lease of a
car occurs during that income year—so much of the amount
(also an accrual amount) worked out under subsection (2)
for that luxury car lease payment period as may appropriately
be related to that income year in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.
(2) The amount is:
Outstanding notional loan principal at ´ Implicit interest rate
the start of the lease payment period

where:
implicit interest rate is the implicit interest rate under the lease for
the *luxury car lease payment period, taking into account the
payments to be made by the lessee under the lease and any
*termination amounts.
outstanding notional loan principal at the start of the lease
payment period is:
(a) the sum of the notional loan principal and the accrual
amounts for earlier *luxury car lease payment periods; less
(b) the sum of the *luxury car lease payments that the lessee was
required to make before the start of the relevant luxury car
lease payment period.

Excessive periods
(3) If, apart from this subsection, a *luxury car lease payment period
for the lease of a *car would exceed 6 months, this Division applies
as if each of the following were a separate luxury car lease
payment period:
(a) the first 6 months of the original luxury car lease payment
period;
(b) if the original luxury car lease payment period was not longer
than 12 months—the remaining part of the original luxury
car lease payment period;
(c) if the original luxury car lease payment period was longer
than 12 months—each successive 6 month period in the
original luxury car lease payment period;
(d) the period (if any) after the end of the last of the periods to
which paragraph (c) applies.

242-40 Treatment of lease payments
(1) The *luxury car lease payments under the lease are not assessable
income and are not *exempt income of the lessor.
Note:

Those lease payments are instead taken into account in calculating
accrual amounts that are included in the lessor’s assessable income
under section 242-35.

(2) In working out the amounts the lessor can deduct for any income
year, ignore the fact that subsection (1) makes the *luxury car lease
payments *non-assessable non-exempt income.
Note:

This allows the lessor to continue to deduct amounts related to earning
the lease payments (such as interest on an amount the lessor borrowed
to acquire the car), just as if the amounts related to earning interest on
the notional loan to the lessee.

Subdivision 242-D—Adjustments if total amount assessed to

Guide to Subdivision 242-D
242-60 What this Subdivision is about
When a luxury car lease is extended, renewed or ends, the overall
nominal gain to the lessor is compared to the nominal interest so
far paid under the lease.
If the overall nominal gain is greater, the difference is assessable
income of the lessor, and the lessee may be able to deduct it.
If the overall nominal gain is less, the lessor can deduct the
difference, which may also be assessable income of the lessee.
This process ensures that the right amount has been taxed over the
term of the lease.

(a) if the term of the lease is extended—when the extension
takes effect;
(b) if the lease is renewed—when the renewal takes effect;
(c) when the lease (including any extension or renewal of the
lease) ends.
(2) If the sum of all amounts (whether *luxury car lease payments, a
*termination amount or any other payments) that were paid or
payable to the lessor under the lease exceeds the amount worked
out under subsection (4), the excess is included in the lessor’s
assessable income for the income year in which the relevant time
occurs.
Note:

Subsection 242-80(8) treats the amount of a notional loan that is taken
to be made by an extended or renewed lease to be a termination
amount paid under the previous lease.

(3) If the sum of all amounts (whether *luxury car lease payments, a
*termination amount or any other payments) that were paid or
payable to the lessor under the lease is less than the amount worked
out under subsection (4), the lessor can deduct the difference for
the income year in which the relevant time occurs.
(4) The amount for the purposes of subsections (2) and (3) is the sum
of:
(a) the notional loan principal; and
(b) the sum of the accrual amounts that have been or are to be
included in the lessor’s assessable income of any income
year.
Note:

For accrual amount, see subsection 242-35(1).

(4) This Act has effect as if the notional loan that arose because of the
grant of the lease, or because of the previous extension or renewal,
had been repaid.
Note:

Also, Subdivision 242-D (about balancing adjustments) will apply to

(b) of an amount (the notional loan principal) equal to the *car’s
*market value when the extension or renewal is granted; and
(c) subject to the payment of interest.
(6) This Act has effect as if the notional loan principal were repaid,
and the interest were paid, by the making of the *luxury car lease

disregard any period after the end of the lease (or the end of any
extension of the lease term or renewal of the lease) and before the
extension or renewal (or further extension or renewal) is granted
and during which the lessee did not have the *right to use the *car if
the extension or renewal (or further extension or renewal):
(a) has effect from the time immediately after the end of that
term, extension or renewal; or
(b) otherwise results in substantial continuity of the leasing of
the car to the lessee.
(8) The amount of the notional loan is treated, for the purposes of
section 242-65 (about the lessor’s balancing adjustments), as a
*termination amount paid to the lessor under the lease or under the
previous extension or renewal.

243-10 What this Division is about
This Division tells you when you must include an additional
amount in your assessable income at the termination of a limited
recourse debt arrangement. It also tells you what the additional
amount is.
Basically, the Division applies where the capital allowance
deductions that have been obtained for expenditure that is funded
by the debt and the deductions are excessive having regard to the
amount of the debt that was repaid.
The reason for the adjustment is to ensure that, where you have not
been fully at risk in relation to an amount of expenditure, you do
not get a net deduction if you fail to pay that amount.

Operative provisions
243-15 When does this Division apply?
(1) This Division applies if:
(a) *limited recourse debt has been used to wholly or partly
finance or refinance expenditure; and
(b) at the time that the debt *arrangement is terminated, the debt
has not been paid in full by the debtor; and
(c) the debtor can deduct an amount as a *capital allowance for
the income year in which the termination occurs, or has
deducted or can deduct an amount for an earlier income year,
in respect of the expenditure or the *financed property.
Note:

This Division does not apply to certain limited recourse debts that are
used to refinance limited recourse debt to which this Division has
applied (see subsection 243-50(4)).

(2) However, unless the net *capital allowance deductions have been
excessive having regard to the amount of the debt that remains
unpaid (see section 243-35), no amount is included in the debtor’s
assessable income under this Division although future deductions
may be reduced.
(3) In working out if the debt has been paid in full, and in working out
the unpaid amount of the debt, the following amounts are to be
treated as if they were not payments in respect of the debt:
(a) any reduction in the debt as a result of the *financed property
being surrendered or returned to the creditor at the
termination of the debt;
(b) any payment to reduce the debt that is funded directly or
indirectly by *non-arm’s length limited recourse debt or by
proceeds from the disposal of the debtor’s interest in the
financed property.

However, any amounts accrued that are interest, *notional interest
or in the nature of interest are taken not to be unpaid.
(4) In working out if the debt has been paid in full, and in working out
the unpaid amount of the debt, payments are to be attributed first to
the payment of any accrued amounts that are interest, *notional
interest or in the nature of interest.
(5) A notional loan arising because of Division 240 (about
arrangements treated as a sale and loan) is taken to be a debt that
has been used to wholly or partly finance or refinance expenditure.

243-20 What is limited recourse debt?
(1) A limited recourse debt is an obligation imposed by law on an
entity (the debtor) to pay an amount to another entity (the creditor)
where the rights of the creditor as against the debtor in the event of
default in payment of the debt or of interest are limited wholly or
predominantly to any or all of the following:
(a) rights (including the right to money payable) in relation to
any or all of the following:
(i) the *debt property or the use of the debt property;
(ii) goods produced, supplied, carried, transmitted or
delivered, or services provided, by means of the debt
property;
(iii) the loss or disposal of the whole or a part of the debt
property or of the debtor’s interest in the debt property;
(b) rights in respect of a mortgage or other security over the debt
property or other property;
(c) rights that arise out of any *arrangement relating to the
financial obligations of an end-user of the *financed property
towards the debtor, and are financial obligations in relation to
the financed property.
(2) An obligation imposed by law on an entity (the debtor) to pay an
amount to another entity (the creditor) is also a limited recourse
debt if it is reasonable to conclude that the rights of the creditor as

(a) are capable of being limited in the way mentioned in
subsection (1); or
(b) are in substance or effect limited wholly or predominantly to
rights (including the right to money payable) in relation to
any or all of the following:
(i) the *debt property or the use of the debt property;
(ii) goods produced, supplied, carried, transmitted or
delivered, or services provided, by means of the debt
property;
(iii) the loss or disposal of the whole or a part of the debt
property or of the debtor’s interest in the debt property.
Note:

Paragraph (b) could apply to a special purpose entity. For example, an
entity’s only significant asset is one that it financed by way of a bank
loan. The bank’s rights to recover the debt (if the entity defaults) are
not contractually limited, however they are in effect limited to rights
in relation to the asset.

(3) An obligation imposed by law on an entity (the debtor) to pay an
amount to another entity (the creditor) is also a limited recourse
debt if there is no *debt property and it is reasonable to conclude
that the rights of the creditor as against the debtor in the event of
default in payment of the debt or of interest are capable of being
limited.
(3A) In reaching a conclusion for the purposes of subsection (2) or (3),
have regard to the following:
(a) the debtor’s assets (other than assets that are indemnities or
guarantees provided in relation to the debt);
(b) any *arrangement to which the debtor is a party;
(c) except for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b)—whether all of
the debtor’s assets would be available for the purpose of
discharging the debt (other than assets that are security for
other debts of the debtor or any other entity);
(d) whether the debtor and creditor are dealing at *arm’s length
in relation to the debt.

(4) A notional loan arising because of Division 240 (about
arrangements treated as a sale and loan) under a *hire purchase
agreement is also a limited recourse debt.
(5) However, an obligation that is covered by subsection (1) is not a
limited recourse debt if the creditor’s recourse is not in practice
limited due to the creditor’s rights in respect of a mortgage or other
security over property of the debtor (other than the financed
property) the value of which exceeds, or is likely to exceed, the
amount of the debt.
(6) Also, an obligation that is covered by subsection (1), (2) or (3) is
not a limited recourse debt if, having regard to all relevant
circumstances, it would be unreasonable for the obligation to be
treated as limited recourse debt.
(7) A *limited recourse debt is a non-arm’s length limited recourse
debt if the debtor and creditor do not deal with each other at *arm’s
length in relation to the debt.

243-25 When is a debt arrangement terminated?
(1) A debt arrangement is taken to have terminated if:
(a) it is actually terminated; or
(b) the debtor’s obligation to repay the debt is waived, novated
or otherwise varied so as to reduce, transfer or extinguish the
debt; or
(c) an agreement is entered into to waive, novate or otherwise
vary the debtor’s obligation to repay the debt so as to reduce,
transfer or extinguish the debt; or
(d) the creditor ceases to have an entitlement to recover the debt
from the debtor (other than as a result of an *arm’s length
assignment of some or all of the creditor’s rights under the
debt arrangement); or
(e) the debtor ceases to be the owner or the *quasi-owner of
some or all of the *debt property because that property is
surrendered to the creditor because of the debtor’s failure to

(1) Property is the financed property if the expenditure referred to in
paragraph 243-15(1)(a) is on the property, is on the acquisition of
the property, results in the creation of the property or is otherwise
connected with the property.
(2) If the debt agreement is a notional loan arising under Division 240
(about arrangements treated as a sale and loan), the property that is
the subject of the agreement is the financed property.

(b) the property is provided as security for the debt.

(1) The *capital allowance deductions have been excessive having

(2) This is how to work out the total net *capital allowance deductions:
Working out the total net capital allowance deductions
Step 1.

Add up all of the debtor’s *capital allowance deductions
in respect of the expenditure or the *financed property
(including deductions because of balancing adjustments)
for the income year in which the termination occurs or an
earlier income year.
Note:

The amount of a capital allowance deduction may be
reduced under section 707-415.

Step 2.

Deduct from that any amount that is included in the
assessable income of the debtor of any income year by
virtue of a provision of this Act (other than this Division)
as a result of the disposal of the *financed property the
effect of which is to reverse a deduction covered by Step
1.

Step 3.

Deduct from the result an amount equal to the sum of any
amounts included in the entity’s assessable income as a
result of an earlier application of this Division to the
debt.

debt) because of payments in respect of the debt.

(3) The reference in step 2 of the method statement in subsection (2) to
an amount that is included in the assessable income of a taxpayer
as a result of the disposal of the *financed property includes a
reference to an amount that is included under section 26AG of the

This Division applies to a partnership in respect of the
partnership’s debts and in respect of debts of a partner, and
references to a debtor include a reference to a partnership.

243-65 Application where partner reduces liability
(1) This section applies to a debt in relation to a partner in a
partnership if:
(a) in connection with an *arrangement, the partner’s liability to
pay the debt is reduced or eliminated and the partner’s
interest in the partnership ceases or is varied or transferred;
and

Specialist liability rules Chapter 3
Financial transactions Part 3-10

Section 243-65
Working out the amount included
Step 1.

Work out which income years the partner was a member
of the partnership and the partnership was entitled to a
*capital allowance deduction in respect of the expenditure
or the *financed property (including deductions because
of balancing adjustments).

Step 2.

For each of those income years, work out the proportion
of net income of the partnership or the partnership loss
(as the case requires) that was included in the assessable
income of the partner or which the partner could deduct.

Step 3.

For each of those income years, multiply the *capital
allowance deductions in respect of the expenditure or the
*financed property (including deductions because of
balancing adjustments) of the partnership by the
corresponding proportion worked out under Step 2. Sum
all of the amounts.

Step 4.

Divide the sum by the total of the *capital allowance
deductions in respect of the expenditure or the *financed
property (including deductions because of balancing
adjustments) of the partnership for all of those income
years.

Step 5.

Work out the amount that would have been included in
the partnership’s assessable income under section 243-40
if the debt had been terminated and remained unpaid and
this section had not applied.

Step 6.

Multiply the amount worked out in Step 5 by the factor
worked out in Step 4. The result is the amount to be
included in the partner’s assessable income.

245-1 What this Division is about
When a creditor forgives a commercial debt you owe, you make a
gain. This is usually not included in your assessable income.
Instead, this Division offsets the forgiven amount against amounts
that could otherwise reduce your taxable income in the same or a
later income year. Those amounts are:
(a) your tax losses and net capital losses; and
(b) capital allowances and some similar deductions; and
(c) the cost bases of your CGT assets.

245-2 Simplified outline of this Division
(1) This Division applies to any commercial debt (or part of a
commercial debt) you owe that is forgiven.
Note:

This Division does not apply if:
(a) the debt is waived and the waiver constitutes a fringe benefit; or

(d) the debt is forgiven by will; or
(e) the debt is forgiven for reasons of natural love and affection; or
(f) the debt is a tax-related liability.

(2) The net forgiven amount of a debt is worked out by reducing the
value of your forgiven debt by:
(a) any consideration you provided for the forgiveness; and
(b) any amounts that this Act already brings to account because
of the forgiveness.
(3) The net forgiven amounts of all your forgiven debts in an income
year are added up. This total net forgiven amount is applied to
reduce the following amounts (in the following order):
(a) your tax losses from previous income years;
(b) your net capital losses from previous income years;
(c) the deductions you would otherwise get in the income year,
or in a later year, because of expenditure from a previous
year (e.g. the capital allowance deductions you would get for
the cost of a depreciating asset);

A debt is forgiven if and when the creditor assigns the right to
receive payment of the debt to another entity (the new creditor)
and the following conditions are met:
(a) either the new creditor is the debtor’s *associate or the
assignment occurred under an *arrangement to which the new
creditor and debtor were parties;

245-48 What this Subdivision is about
The amount of forgiveness (called the gross forgiven amount) for
the debtor reflects the loss that the creditor makes for tax purposes.
It is worked out in 2 steps:
(a) the value of the debt when it was forgiven is worked out
on the basis that you were solvent both then and when
you incurred the debt; and
(b) the value of the debt is then offset by any consideration
given for the forgiveness of the debt.
The difference between the value of the debt and the amount offset
is the gross forgiven amount.
If the debt was owed by several debtors, the gross forgiven amount
is divided between them equally.

Section 245-50

Working out the value of a debt
245-50 Extent of forgiveness if consideration is given
If any consideration is paid or given in respect of the *forgiveness
of a debt, the debt that is forgiven is:
(a) the obligation that existed before the forgiveness to pay so
much of the debt as is expressed, or is taken, to be forgiven;
and
(b) the obligation that existed before the forgiveness to pay any
part of the debt to which paragraph (a) does not apply but
which ceases to be payable as a result of the payment or
giving of the consideration.
Example: Daniel owes Samara $100. Samara agrees to accept $60 in full
payment of the debt.
If their agreement specifies that Samara forgives the whole debt in
return for $60, paragraph (a) provides that the forgiven debt is $100.
If their agreement instead requires Daniel to repay $60 and specifies
that Samara forgives the remaining $40, paragraph (a) would deal
with the $40 and paragraph (b) would add the remaining $60, again
producing a forgiven amount of $100.
In either case, the $60 Daniel pays is offset against the forgiven
amount of $100 in working out the gross forgiven amount of the debt:
see sections 245-65 and 245-75.

245-55 General rule for working out the value of a debt
(1) The value of your debt at the time (the forgiveness time) when it is
*forgiven is the amount that would have been its *market value
(considered as an asset of the creditor) at the forgiveness time,
assuming that:
(a) when you incurred the debt, you were able to pay all your
debts (including that one) as and when they fell due; and
(b) your capacity to pay the debt is the same at the forgiveness
time as when you incurred it.

(2) However, the value of the debt at the forgiveness time is the sum of
the following amounts, if that sum is less than the amount
applicable under subsection (1):
(a) what would have been the amount applicable under
subsection (1) if there had been no change, from the time the
debt was incurred until the forgiveness time, in any rate of
interest, or rate of exchange between currencies, that affects
the *market value of the debt;
(b) each amount:
(i) that you have deducted or can deduct as a result of the
*forgiveness of the debt; and
(ii) that is attributable to such a change.

245-80 What this Subdivision is about
The net forgiven amount of a debt is worked out by subtracting,
from the gross forgiven amount of the debt, any amount that this
Act already takes into account for the debtor because the debt was
forgiven (for example, if some part of the forgiven amount is
treated as the debtor’s ordinary income).
If the debtor and creditor were companies under common
ownership, they may agree to transfer some of the net forgiven
amount from the debtor to the creditor. The creditor must apply
that amount to reduce the capital loss or deduction it has because of
the forgiveness.

(a) it was incurred in respect of an asset you *disposed of to an
entity that you dealt with at *arm’s length in respect of the
disposal; and
(b) the disposal occurred during the *forgiveness income year
before the *forgiveness of any debt owed by you, and the
forgiveness resulted in a *net forgiven amount; and

assessable income, or allows you a deduction, as a result of
the disposal.

245-150 Allocation of remaining total net forgiven amount in respect
of expenditures

Division 247 Capital protected borrowings

Section 247-10
247-10 What capital protected borrowing and capital protection are
(1) An *arrangement under which a *borrowing is made, or credit is
provided, is a capital protected borrowing if the borrower is
wholly or partly protected against a fall in the *market value of a
thing (the protected thing) to the extent that:
(a) the borrower uses the amount borrowed or credit provided to
acquire the protected thing; or
(b) the borrower uses the protected thing as security for the
borrowing or provision of credit.
(2) That protection is called capital protection.

247-15 Application of this Division
(1) This Division applies to a *capital protected borrowing only if the
protected thing is a beneficial interest in:
(a) a *share, a unit in a unit trust or a stapled security; or
(b) an entity that holds a beneficial interest in a share, unit in a
unit trust or stapled security either directly, or indirectly
through one or more interposed entities.
(2) This Division applies only to borrowers under *capital protected
borrowings.
(3) This Division does not apply to a *capital protected borrowing if:
(a) an *ESS interest is acquired under the borrowing; and
(b) Subdivision 83A-B or 83A-C (about employee share
schemes) applies to the ESS interest.
(4) This Division does not apply to a *capital protected borrowing
entered into before 1 July 2007 (except to the extent that it is
extended on or after that day) unless the *share, unit in a unit trust
or stapled security is listed for quotation in the official list of an
*approved stock exchange.
(5) This Division does not apply to a *capital protected borrowing
entered into on or after 1 July 2007 if:

Section 247-20
(a) the protected thing is a beneficial interest in:
(i) a *share, unit or stapled security that is not listed for
quotation in the official list of an *approved stock
exchange; or
(ii) an entity that holds a beneficial interest in a share, unit
in a unit trust or stapled security either directly, or
indirectly through one or more interposed entities, that
is not so listed; and
(b) one of these conditions is satisfied:
(i) for a non-listed share—the company is not a *widely
held company;
(ii) for a non-listed unit—the trust is not a widely held unit
trust as defined in section 272-105 in Schedule 2F to the
Income Tax Assessment Act 1936;
(iii) for a non-listed stapled security—any company
involved is not a widely held company and any trust
involved is not such a widely held unit trust.

247-20 Treating capital protection as a put option
(1) This section applies to a borrower if:
(aa) the borrower has an excess using the method statement in
subsection (3) for:
(i) a *capital protected borrowing entered into after 7.30
pm, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on
13 May 2008 (the 2008 Budget time); or
(ii) an extension of the capital protected borrowing; or
(a) the borrower has an amount that is reasonably attributable to
the *capital protection as mentioned in subsection (2) for a
capital protected borrowing entered into or extended on or
after 1 July 2007 and at or before the 2008 Budget time; or
(b) the borrower has an amount that is reasonably attributable to
the capital protection as mentioned in subsection (2) for a
capital protected borrowing entered into or extended at or
after 9.30 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital
Territory, on 16 April 2003 and before 1 July 2007.

Section 247-20
Note:

If a capital protected borrowing covered by paragraph (1)(a) or (b) is
extended or otherwise changed after the 2008 Budget time,
section 247-85 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997
applies to the capital protected borrowing.

(2) For paragraphs (1)(a) and (b), the amount that is reasonably
attributable to the *capital protection is worked out under
Division 247 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act
1997.
(3) This is the method statement.
Method statement
Step 1.

Work out the total amount incurred by the borrower
under or in respect of the *capital protected borrowing for
the income year, ignoring amounts that are not in
substance for *capital protection or interest.

Step 2.

Work out the total interest that would have been incurred
for the income year on a *borrowing or provision of
credit of the same amount as under the *capital protected
borrowing at the rate applicable under either or both of
subsections (4) and (5A).

Step 3.

If the step 1 amount exceeds the step 2 amount, the
excess is reasonably attributable to the *capital protection
for the income year.

Example: Amounts that would be ignored under step 1 include amounts that are
in substance the repayment of a loan or credit, the payment of an
application fee or brokerage commission and the payment of stamp
duty or other tax.

(4) If:
(a) the *capital protected borrowing is at a fixed rate for all or
part of the term of the capital protected borrowing; and
(b) that fixed rate is applicable to the capital protected borrowing
for all or part of the income year;

use the rate worked out under subsection (5) at the first time an
amount covered by step 1 of the method statement in
subsection (3) was incurred, in any income year, during the term of
the capital protected borrowing or that part of the term.
(5) The rate (the adjusted loan rate), at a particular time, is the sum of:
(a) the Reserve Bank of Australia’s Indicator Lending Rate for
Standard Variable Housing Loans at that time; and
(b) 100 basis points.
(5A) If:
(a) the *capital protected borrowing is at a variable rate for all or
part of the term of the capital protected borrowing; and
(b) a variable rate is applicable to the capital protected
borrowing for all or part of the income year;
use the average of the adjusted loan rates applicable during those
parts of the income year when the capital protected borrowing is at
a variable rate.
(6) If this section applies to a borrower, this Act applies as if:
(a) the borrower’s excess from the method statement in
subsection (3); or
(b) the amount that is reasonably attributable to *capital
protection as mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) or (b);
(reduced by any amount the borrower incurred under or in respect
of the *capital protected borrowing for an explicit put option) were
incurred only for a put option granted by the lender or by another
entity under the *arrangement.

247-25 Number of put options
(1) If a *capital protected borrowing specifies more than one occasion
on which the *capital protection can be invoked, this Act applies as
if there were a separate put option for each of those occasions. So
much of the amount to which subsection 247-20(6) applies as is
reasonably attributable to each option is taken to have been
incurred for that option.

this Act applies as if there were a single put option for that period.

247-30 Exercise or expiry of option
(1) If the *capital protection under a *capital protected borrowing is
invoked:
(a) the borrower is taken to have exercised the put option; and
(b) any interest in a *share, unit in a unit trust or stapled security
that is acquired by the lender or another entity under the
*arrangement as a result of that capital protection being
invoked is taken to have been disposed of by the borrower as
a result of the exercise of the option.
(2) If the *capital protection under a *capital protected borrowing is not
invoked on or before the last occasion on which it could have been,
the put option is taken to have expired.
Note:

If a borrower under a capital protected borrowing holds the protected
things on capital account, the exercise or expiry of the put option may
give rise to a capital gain or capital loss: see sections 104-25 (CGT
event C2) and 134-1 (exercise of options).

250-1 What this Division is about
This Division denies or reduces certain capital allowance
deductions that would otherwise be available to you in relation to
an asset if the asset is put to a tax preferred use in certain
circumstances.
If the capital allowance deductions are denied or reduced, certain
financial benefits in relation to the tax preferred use of the asset are
assessed only to the extent of a notional gain component. This
component is worked out on the basis of treating the arrangements
under which the asset is put to a tax preferred use, and financial
benefits are provided in relation to that tax preferred use, as a loan.
Subdivision 250-E then applies to determine the amounts that are
to be assessed.

(or the use of the asset under a lease or hire arrangement),
section 250-30 does not apply if:
(a) the asset is so specialised that the *end user could not carry

(a) a *member of the tax preferred sector has a right, if particular
circumstances occur, to manage, or to assume control over,
the asset (other than temporarily for the purpose of ensuring

amount is the sum of the present values of all the amounts that
would be likely to be included in your assessable income under this
Division in relation to the *tax preferred use of the asset if this
Division applied to you and the asset.
(3) This is how to work out the alternative assessable amount for the
purposes of subsection (1):
Method statement
Step 1.

Add up the present values of the amounts that would be
included in your assessable income in relation to the
*financial benefits *provided in relation to the tax
preferred use of the asset during the *arrangement period
if this Division did not apply to you and the asset.

Step 2.

Add up the present values of the amounts that you would
be able to deduct in relation to the asset, or expenditure in
relation to the asset, under Division 40 or Division 43 in
relation to the *arrangement period if this Division did
not apply to you and the asset.

Step 3.

Deduct the amount obtained in Step 2 from the amount
obtained in Step 1. The result is the alternative
assessable amount.

(4) To avoid doubt, the amounts referred to in subsections (2) and (3)
are all the amounts that would be likely to be included in your
assessable income, or deducted, for all the income years during the
whole, or a part, of which the asset is *put to the tax preferred use.

(a) the *tax preferred use of an asset by an entity; and

*put to a tax preferred use; and
(b) the *arrangement period for the *tax preferred use of the asset
ends on a particular date (the termination date); and
(c) the asset continues to be put to the tax preferred use after the
termination date;
the tax preferred use of the asset after the termination date is taken
to be a separate and distinct tax preferred use of the asset from the
tax preferred use of the asset before the termination date.
Note:

This means, among other things, that there is a new arrangement
period for the tax preferred use after the termination date and that the

Section 250-80
(2) Whether a particular composite item is itself an asset or whether its
components are separate assets is a question of fact and degree
which can only be determined in the light of all the circumstances
of the particular case.
Example 1: A car is made up of many separate components, but usually the car is
an asset rather than each component.
Example 2: A floating restaurant consists of many separate components (like the
ship itself, stoves, fridges, furniture, crockery and cutlery), but usually
these components are treated as separate assets.

(3) This Division applies to a renewal or extension of an asset that is a
right as if the renewal or extension were a continuation of the
original right.
(4) This Division applies to an asset (the underlying asset) in which:
(a) you have an interest; and
(b) one or more other entities also have an interest;
as if your interest in the underlying asset were itself the underlying
asset.

250-80 Treatment of particular arrangements in the same way as
leases
This Division applies to an *arrangement that:
(a) in substance or effect, depends on the use of a specific asset
that is:
(i) real property; or
(ii) goods or a personal chattel (other than money or a
money equivalent); and
(b) gives a right to control the use of the asset (other than
temporarily for the purpose of ensuring public health or
safety, protecting the environment or continuing the supply
of an essential service); and
(c) is not a lease;
in the same way as it applies to a lease.

Financial benefits in relation to tax preferred use
250-85 Financial benefits in relation to tax preferred use of an asset
(1) For the purposes of this Division, the *financial benefits provided
in relation to a tax preferred use of an asset include (but are not
limited to):

(i) bringing the asset into a state, condition or location in
which it can be *put to the tax preferred use; or
(ii) the start of the *tax preferred use of the asset; and
(b) a financial benefit provided in relation to the end of the tax
preferred use of the asset; and
(c) a financial benefit provided in relation to the termination or
expiration of an *arrangement that deals with:
(i) the tax preferred use of the asset; or
(ii) the provision of financial benefits in relation to the tax
preferred use of the asset; and
(d) a financial benefit provided in relation to the purchase or
acquisition of the asset by, or transfer of the asset to, the *tax
preferred end user (or a *connected entity).
(2) Without limiting paragraph (1)(b), if the asset has a *guaranteed
residual value:
(a) the amount of the guaranteed residual value is taken to be a
*financial benefit provided in relation to the tax preferred
use of the asset; and
(b) that financial benefit is taken to be provided when the
relevant payment is made in relation to the guaranteed
residual value.
(3) The asset has a guaranteed residual value if there is an

Note:

This subsection means that if section 250-135 does not apply to the

disregard *financial benefits provided before subsection (2) or (3)
of this section ceased to apply to the asset.
Note:

If:
(a) subsection (2) or (3) ceases to apply to the asset at a particular
time under this subsection; and
(b) the asset is retested at that time against section 250-135; and
(c) on the retesting, that section is found to apply to the asset at that
time;
subsection (3) will start to apply to the asset again from that time
because paragraph (3)(b) will have been satisfied.

Clarification that retesting only required if you do something to
increase value of expected benefits
(6) To avoid doubt, subsection (2) or (3) does not cease to apply
merely because the value of the *expected financial benefits in
relation to the asset increase because of something other than
action taken, or an omission made, by you (or a *connected entity)
or a *member of the tax preferred sector.
Note:

This subsection means that retesting under subsection (4) is not
triggered by an increase in the value of expected financial benefits that

You recognise gains and losses from the financial arrangement, as
appropriate, over the life of the financial arrangement and ignore
distinctions between income and capital. You use a compounding
accruals method to recognise the gain or loss.
A change in circumstances may cause a re-estimation of gains and
losses that the accruals method is being applied to.

Section 250-255
250-255 When to re-estimate
When re-estimation necessary
(1) You re-estimate a gain or loss from the *financial arrangement
under subsection (4) if circumstances arise that materially affect:
(a) the amount or value; or
(b) the timing;
of *financial benefits that were taken into account in working out
the amount of the gain or loss. You must re-estimate the gain or
loss as soon as reasonably practicable after you become aware of
the circumstances referred to in paragraph (b).
(2) Without limiting subsection (1), the following are circumstances of
the kind referred to in paragraph (1)(b):
(a) a material change in market conditions that are relevant to the
amount or value of the *financial benefits to be received or
provided under the *financial arrangement;
(b) cash flows that were previously estimated becoming known
and the difference between the cash flows that become
known and the cash flows that were previously estimated is
not insignificant;
(c) a right to, or a part of a right to, a financial benefit under the
arrangement is written off as a bad debt.
(3) You do not re-estimate a gain or loss from a *financial arrangement
under subsection (4) merely because of any one or more of the
following:
(a) a change in the credit rating, or the creditworthiness, of a
party or parties to the financial arrangement;
(b) the impairment (within the meaning of the *accounting
standards) of the arrangement or a debt that forms part of the
arrangement.

Section 250-255
Nature of re-estimation
(4) Making a re-estimation in relation to a gain or loss under this
subsection involves:
(a) a fresh determination of the amount of the gain or loss; and
(b) a reapplication of the accruals method to the redetermined
gain or loss to make a fresh allocation of the part of the
redetermined gain or loss that has not already been allocated
to intervals ending before the re-estimation is made to
intervals ending after the re-estimation is made.
Basis for re-estimation
(5) You may make the fresh allocation of the gain or loss under
subsection (4) on either of the following bases:
(a) by maintaining the rate of return being used and adjusting the
amount to which you apply the rate of return to the present
value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the
maintained rate of return;
(b) adjusting the rate of return and maintaining the amount to
which you apply the rate of return.
The object to be achieved by both bases is allow you to bring the
remainder of the gain or loss based on the new estimates properly
to account over the remainder of the period over which you spread
the gain or loss.
(6) If you adopt a particular basis under subsection (5) for a gain or
loss from the *financial arrangement, you must use the same basis
for all the re-estimations you make under this section in relation to
your gains and losses from all your financial arrangements.
Balancing adjustment if rate of return maintained
(7) If you make a fresh allocation of the gain or loss on the basis
referred to in paragraph (5)(a), you must make the following
balancing adjustment:
(a) if you re-estimate a gain and the amount to which you apply
the rate of return increases—you make a gain from the

Re-estimation if balancing adjustment on partial disposal
(1) You also re-estimate a gain or loss from a *financial arrangement
under subsection (2) if a balancing adjustment is made in relation
to the financial arrangement under sections 250-265 to 250-275
because you transfer to another person:
(a) a proportionate share of all of your rights and/or obligations
under a *financial arrangement; or
(b) a right or obligation that you have under a financial
arrangement to a specifically identified *financial benefit; or

(b)

the amount or value of any other consideration you
provide in relation to the transfer or cessation
referred to in subsection 250-265(1);

Section 253-5

Operative provisions
253-5 Payment of entitlement under financial claims scheme treated
as payment from ADI
(1) This Act applies to you as if an amount paid to you, or applied for
your benefit, to meet your entitlement under Division 2AA
(Financial claims scheme for account-holders with insolvent ADIs)
of Part II of the Banking Act 1959 connected with an account with
an *ADI had been paid to you by the ADI under the terms and
conditions of the agreement for keeping the account.
Note:

This section has effect subject to more detailed provisions about:
(a) entitlements relating to retirement savings accounts (see
section 306-25); and
(b) entitlements relating to farm management deposits (see
Subdivision 393-C).

(2) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not affect the operation of
Part 2-5 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953.
Note:

Division 21 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953
contains special provisions about how Part 2-5 in that Schedule
operates in relation to the meeting of entitlements under Division 2AA
of Part II of the Banking Act 1959.

253-10 Disposal of rights against ADI to APRA and meeting of
financial claims scheme entitlement have no CGT effects
Disregard a *capital gain or *capital loss you make:
(a) because of the operation of section 16AI of the Banking Act
1959; or
(b) because your entitlement under Subdivision C of
Division 2AA of Part II of that Act is met.
Note:

Section 16AI of the Banking Act 1959 reduces the right of an
account-holder who has a protected account with a declared ADI to be
paid an amount by the ADI, by the account-holder’s entitlement under
Subdivision C of Division 2AA of Part II of that Act to be paid an
amount by APRA in connection with the account.

Division 253 Financial claims scheme for account-holders with insolvent ADIs

Section 253-15
253-15 Cost base of financial claims scheme entitlement and any
remaining part of account that gave rise to entitlement
(1) This section applies if an entitlement arises under Division 2AA
(Financial claims scheme for account-holders with insolvent ADIs)
of Part II of the Banking Act 1959 in connection with an
account-holder’s account with an *ADI.
(2) The *cost base and *reduced cost base of the *CGT asset consisting
of the entitlement are each the amount of the entitlement.
(3) The *cost base of the *CGT asset representing the part (if any) of
the account-holder’s right to be paid an amount by the *ADI in
connection with the account that remains after the reduction of that
right by section 16AI of the Banking Act 1959 (by the amount of
the entitlement) is the difference (if any) between:
(a) the cost base of the right as it was immediately before the
reduction; and
(b) the amount of the entitlement.
The *reduced cost base is worked out similarly.
(4) This section has effect despite:
(a) Division 110 (Cost base and reduced cost base); and
(b) subsections 112-30(2), (3), (4) and (5) (which are about
apportioning a *cost base if a *CGT event happens to only
part of a *CGT asset).
