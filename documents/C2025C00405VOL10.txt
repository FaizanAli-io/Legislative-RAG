(1) To deduct a *work expense:
(a) it must qualify as a deduction under some provision of this
Act outside this Division; and
(b) you need to substantiate it by getting written evidence.
Subdivision 900-E tells you about the evidence you need.
To find out whether an expense qualifies as a deduction under this Act, see
Division 8 (Deductions).

(2) If your expense is for fuel or oil, you have a choice of either:
(a) getting written evidence of it under Subdivision 900-E; or
(b) keeping odometer records for the period when you owned or
leased the *car in the income year.
Subdivision 28-H tells you about odometer records.
Note:

In certain circumstances (for example, under a hire purchase
agreement) the notional buyer of property is taken to be its owner (see
subsection 240-20(2)).

900-20 Keeping travel records
You need to keep travel records if your expense is for travel that
involves you being away from your ordinary residence for 6 or

900-25 Retaining the written evidence and travel records
(1) Once you have the material required by section 900-15 or 900-20,
you must retain it for 5 years. There is no need to lodge it with
your *income tax return. The Commissioner may require you to
produce it: see Subdivision 900-G. The period for which you must
retain it is called the retention period.
(2) The 5 years start on the due day for lodging your *income tax
return for the income year. If you lodge your return later, the 5
years start on the day you lodge it.
(3) However, the *retention period is extended if, when the 5 years
end, you are involved in a dispute with the Commissioner that
relates to the expense. See section 900-170.
(4) If you do not retain the material for the *retention period, you
cannot deduct the expense. If you have already deducted it, your
assessment may be amended to disallow the deduction.
(5) If you lose any of the material, there are rules that might help you
in section 900-205.

900-30 Meaning of work expense
General
(1) A work expense is a loss or outgoing you incur in producing your
salary or wages.

Section 900-30
Travel allowance expenses included
(2) Travel allowance expenses count as *work expenses. A travel
allowance expense is a loss or outgoing you incur for travel that is
covered by a *travel allowance. The loss or outgoing must:
(a) be for accommodation or for food or drink; or
(b) be incidental to the travel.
(3) A travel allowance is an allowance your employer pays or is to pay
to you to cover losses or outgoings:
(a) that you incur for travel away from your ordinary residence
that you undertake in the course of your duties as an
employee; and
(b) that are losses or outgoings for accommodation or for food or
drink, or are incidental to the travel.
The travel may be within or outside Australia.
Note:

This Division also applies to individuals who are not employees: see
section 900-12.

Meal allowance expenses included
(4) Meal allowance expenses count as *work expenses. A meal
allowance expense is a loss or outgoing that you incur for food or
drink that is covered by a *meal allowance.
(5) A meal allowance is an allowance that your employer pays or is to
pay to you as an employee to enable you to buy food or drink.
However, an allowance is not a meal allowance if it is a *travel
allowance or part of one.
Note:

This Division also applies to individuals who are not employees: see
section 900-12.

Motor vehicle expenses excluded
(6) A loss or outgoing to do with a *motor vehicle is not treated as a
*work expense unless it is:
(a) a loss or outgoing incurred, or a payment made, in respect of
travel outside Australia; or

(b) a taxi fare or similar loss or outgoing.
However, most losses or outgoings to do with a *motor vehicle are
covered by the rules about *car expenses. See Division 28 and
Subdivision 900-C.
Other types of losses or outgoings included
(7) In addition to losses or outgoings within the general scope of
subsection (1), any of the following is a *work expense:
(a) the decline in value of property you own and that is used, or
is *installed ready for use, by you in order to produce your
salary or wages;
(b) expenditure you incur that qualifies as a deduction under
section 25-60 (Parliament election expenses) or section 25-65
(about local government election expenses);
(c) expenditure you incur that entitles you to a deduction under
section 25-100 (transport expenses incurred in your travel
between workplaces), other than *car expenses;
(d) a loss or outgoing you incur in relation to producing your
salary or wages that entitles you to a deduction under
section 25-125 (COVID-19 tests).
Note 1:

This Division also applies to payments that are not salary or wages,
but are PAYE earnings: see section 900-12.

Note 2:

In certain circumstances (for example, under a hire purchase
agreement) the notional buyer of property is taken to be its owner (see
subsection 240-20(2)).

Note 3:

See Subdivision 900-C for car expenses that are also transport
expenses incurred in your travel between workplaces.

900-35 Exception for small total of expenses
(1) If the total of all the *work expenses (including *laundry expenses,
but excluding *travel allowance expenses and *meal allowance
expenses) that you want to deduct is $300 or less, you can deduct
them without getting written evidence or keeping travel records.

Section 900-40
Note 1:

If the total is more than $300, you need to substantiate all the work
expenses, not just the excess over $300.

Note 2:

Whether or not your work expenses total $300 or less, for certain
expenses that are each $10 or less and total $200 or less you can get
written evidence by making your own record, instead of getting a
document from the supplier: see section 900-125.

(2) This limit can be increased from time to time by regulations made
under section 909-1.
(3) A *transport expense that Subdivision 900-I (Award transport
payments) lets you deduct without following the rules in this
Division does not count towards this limit.

900-40 Exception for laundry expenses below a certain limit
(1) Even if the *work expenses you claim total more than $300, you
can still deduct up to $150 of *laundry expenses without getting
written evidence of them.
(2) However, this exception does not increase the $300 limit in
section 900-35 to $450: your *laundry expenses still count toward
that limit.
Example: You want to deduct laundry expenses of $140 and union dues of $200.
These work expenses total more than $300, so the exception in
section 900-35 doesn’t apply. This means you must substantiate the
union dues expense. However, because of the exception in this
section, you don’t need to get written evidence of the laundry
expenses.

(3) This limit can be increased from time to time by regulations made
under section 909-1.
(4) A laundry expense is a *work expense to do with washing, drying
or ironing clothes (but not dry cleaning).

900-45 Exception for work expense related to award transport
payment
You may be able to deduct, without getting written evidence or
keeping travel records, a *transport expense you incurred that is
related to an allowance or reimbursement paid or payable to you by
your employer under an *industrial instrument that was in force on
29 October 1986. Subdivision 900-I tells you about this.
Note:

This Division also applies to entities that are not employers, but pay
(or are liable to pay) withholding payments covered by
subsection 900-12(3).

900-50 Exception for domestic travel allowance expenses
(1) You can deduct a *travel allowance expense for travel within
Australia without getting written evidence or keeping travel
records if the Commissioner considers reasonable the total of the
losses or outgoings you claim for travel covered by the allowance.
(2) In deciding whether the total of the losses or outgoings you claim
is reasonable, the Commissioner must take into account the total of
the losses or outgoings of the following kinds that it would be
reasonable for you to incur for the travel:
(a) accommodation;
(b) food or drink;
(c) losses or outgoings incidental to the travel.

900-55 Exception for overseas travel allowance expenses
(1) You can deduct a *travel allowance expense for travel outside
Australia without getting written evidence under the same
conditions as for domestic *travel allowances, except that you still
have to get written evidence for losses or outgoings for
accommodation.
(2) Consequently, in deciding whether the total of the losses or
outgoings you claim is reasonable, the Commissioner must
disregard losses or outgoings for accommodation.

Operative provisions
900-105 Ways of getting written evidence
Each of the following sections has a set of rules for a particular
way of getting written evidence to substantiate a deduction. Which
ones you can use depends on the type of expense. You only need to
use one set of rules to support an expense.

900-110 Time limits
(1) There is no time limit for getting written evidence of an expense
(unless you want to record the expense yourself under
section 900-125 or 900-130). But until you get written evidence of
it, you are not entitled to a deduction for the expense.
(2) If when you lodge your *income tax return for the income year you
have good reason to expect to get written evidence of the expense
within a reasonable time, you can deduct the expense without
actually getting the evidence. But if you don’t get the evidence
within a reasonable time, your entitlement to the deduction ceases.
If you have already deducted the expense, your assessment may be
amended to disallow the deduction.
(3) Even if you only get written evidence of the expense after the end
of the income year, you deduct the expense for that income year,
not the income year in which you get the evidence.

900-115 Written evidence from supplier
(1) You may use this set of rules for any type of expense except the
decline in value of a *depreciating asset.
(2) You must get a document from the supplier of the goods or
services the expense is for. The document must set out:
(a) the name or business name of the supplier; and
(b) the amount of the expense, expressed in the currency in
which it was incurred; and

(c) the nature of the goods or services; and

(e) the day it is made out.
(3) There are 2 exceptions to these requirements:
(a) if the document does not show the day the expense was
incurred, you may use a bank statement or other reasonable,
independent evidence that shows when it was paid;
(b) if the document the supplier gave you does not specify the
nature of the goods or services, you may write in the missing
details yourself before you lodge your *income tax return for
the income year.
(4) The document must be in English. However, if the expense was
incurred in a country outside Australia, the document can instead
be in a language of that country.

900-120 Written evidence of depreciating asset expense
(1) You may use this set of rules only for a *depreciating asset
expense.
(2) You must get evidence of the original acquisition of the
*depreciating asset. It must be a document that you get from the
supplier of the asset and that specifies:
(a) the name or business name of the supplier; and
(b) the cost of the asset to you; and
(c) the nature of the asset; and
(d) the day you acquired the asset; and
(e) the day it is made out.
(3) However, if the document the supplier gave you does not specify
the nature of the asset, you may write in the missing details
yourself before you lodge your *income tax return for the income
year in which you first claim a deduction for the decline in value of
the asset.

expenses, you can make a record of the expenses instead of getting
a document from the supplier.
(2) Each expense must be $10 or less, and the total of all your
expenses that:
(a) are each $10 or less; and
(b) you incurred in the income year and wish to deduct; and
(c) you must get written evidence for under this Division;
must be $200 or less. These limits can be increased from time to
time by regulations made under section 909-1.
(3) If the expense is not the decline in value of a *depreciating asset,
you must get a document with the same information as required by
section 900-115, except that you may create the document and
record all the details yourself. You must do so as soon as possible
after incurring the expense.
(4) If the expense is the decline in value of a *depreciating asset, you
must, as soon as possible after the last day of the income year,
record in a document the following:
(a) the nature of the property;
(b) the amount of the decline in value;
(c) who made the record;
(d) the day the record is made.

substantiate
(1) If the Commissioner considers it unreasonable to expect you to
have got written evidence of an expense in any other way
permitted by this Subdivision, you can use the method in
section 900-125 to get written evidence of your claim.
(2) The expense may be more than $10 and does not count towards the
$200 limit in section 900-125.

900-135 Evidence on a payment summary
(1) If the nature and amount of a *work expense are shown on your
copy of a *payment summary given to you by your employer, you
can use the copy as written evidence of the expense.
Note:

This Division also applies to entities that are not employers, but pay
(or are liable to pay) withholding payments covered by
subsection 900-12(3).

(2) Expenses of the same nature need not be separately itemised; it is
acceptable if they are totalled together on the *payment summary.

Recording activities in travel records
Showing which of your activities were income-producing activities

900-145 Purpose of a travel record
The purpose of a travel record is to show which of your activities
were undertaken in the course of producing your assessable
income, so that your losses or outgoings, or portions of them, can
be attributed to income-producing purposes.

Operative provisions
900-150 Recording activities in travel records
(1) You record an activity by specifying in a diary or similar
document:
(a) the nature of the activity;
(b) the day and approximate time when it began;
(c) how long it lasted;
(d) where you engaged in it.
(2) An activity must be recorded before it ends, or as soon as possible
afterwards. Each entry must be in English.

900-155 Showing which of your activities were income-producing
activities
(1) You need not record an income-producing activity. But if you
don’t, the activity cannot be taken into account in working out the
extent to which you can deduct an expense you incur for the travel.
Example: If you fly to Los Angeles for the sole purpose of attending a 7 day
conference, but you don’t record the conference in your travel record,
you cannot deduct the cost of the air fare. This is so even if you have
written evidence that you paid the fare (eg a receipt), as required by
Subdivision 900-E.

900-175 Commissioner may tell you to produce your records
(1) The Commissioner may give you a written notice telling you to
produce records of expenses specified in the notice. The records
must be ones that you have to retain for the *retention period: you
do not have to produce records if the retention period for those
records is over.
(2) The notice must give you 28 days or more to comply, starting on
the day after the notice is given. The Commissioner may allow you
more time to comply with the notice.

900-180 How to comply with a notice
(1) To comply with the notice, you must produce to the Commissioner,
for each of the expenses, the material that this Division or
Division 28 requires you to retain during the *retention period.
(2) You must also produce a summary that, for each expense for which
you produce written evidence (see Subdivision 900-E):
(a) notes the expense; and
(b) has a cross-reference to the written evidence of the expense;
and
(c) summarises the particulars set out in the written evidence;
and
(d) if the expense was in a foreign currency—shows the amount
of the expense in Australian currency.
The summary must be in English in a form approved by the
Commissioner.

900-185 What happens if you don’t comply
(1) If you do not comply with a notice for a particular expense, you
cannot deduct the expense. If you have already deducted it, your
assessment may be amended to disallow the deduction.

(a) that you incurred the expense; and
(b) that you are entitled to deduct the amount you claim.

was that you had a reasonable expectation that you would not need
to do it in order to be able to deduct that amount.

900-205 What if your documents are lost or destroyed?
(1) If you have a complete copy of a document that is lost or destroyed
during the *retention period, it is treated as the original from the

that you took reasonable precautions to prevent the loss or
destruction, the rest of this section explains what to do.

Section 900-220
900-220 Definition of award transport payment
Award transport payment
(1) An award transport payment is a *transport payment covering
particular travel that was paid under an *industrial instrument that
was in force on 29 October 1986.
Transport payment
(2) A transport payment is an amount your employer pays you, or is
to pay you, for travel by you in the course of working for the
employer that is:
(a) an allowance (or part of an allowance) for the sole or main
purpose of covering your *transport expenses; or
(b) a reimbursement to which section 15-70 applies that is for the
whole or a part of a *car expense. However, an amount is not
a transport payment if it is, or is part of, a *travel allowance.
Note:

This Division also applies to entities that are not employers, but pay
(or are liable to pay) withholding payments covered by
subsection 900-12(3).

Transport expense
(3) A transport expense is a loss or outgoing to do with transport,
including the decline in value of a *depreciating asset used in
connection with transport, but not including a loss or outgoing for
accommodation or for food or drink, or expenditure incidental to
transport.

900-225 Substituted industrial instruments
An *industrial instrument that comes into force in substitution for
another industrial instrument is taken to be a continuation of the
original instrument.

900-230 Changes to industrial instruments applied for before
29 October 1986
(1) Changes made to an *industrial instrument after 29 October 1986
are taken to have been made on 29 October 1986 if they were made
in response to an application made on or before 29 October 1986
that sought increases in *transport payments.
(2) If the application was amended after 29 October 1986, the
alterations made to the *industrial instrument count as being made
on 29 October 1986 only if they did not result in increases in
*transport payments that were greater than increases in those
payments sought by the application as at 29 October 1986.

900-235 Changes to industrial instruments solely referable to
matters in the instrument
Changes made to an *industrial instrument after 29 October 1986
are taken to have been made on 29 October 1986 if the whole
amount of the change is determined solely by reference to matters
that were contained in the industrial instrument on 29 October
1986.

900-240 Deducting in anticipation of receiving award transport
payment
If:
(a) you have incurred a *transport expense during an income
year; and
(b) when you lodge your *income tax return for the income year,
you reasonably believe that you will later receive an *award
transport payment to cover the expense;
you may deduct the expense without getting written evidence or
keeping travel records.

A *transport expense that section 900-215 lets you deduct without
getting written evidence or keeping travel records does not count
towards the $300 limit in section 900-35.
Note:

Section 900-35 tells you that if the total of all the work expenses that
you want to deduct is $300 or less, you can deduct them without
getting written evidence or keeping travel records.

900-250 Effect of exception in this Subdivision on methods of
calculating car expense deductions
(1) If the exception in this Subdivision lets you deduct, without getting
written evidence or keeping travel records, losses or outgoings
(exempt losses or outgoings) that are or include *car expenses, or
parts of *car expenses, your use of the 2 methods for calculating
deductions for car expenses for the *car is affected.
You may elect not to use the exception
(2) However, if you do not want your use of the 2 methods to be
affected, you may elect not to use the exception in this Subdivision
for the *award transport payments you are paid in the income year.
If you so elect, the rest of this section does not affect you.
“Cents per kilometre” method
(3) You can still use the “cents per kilometre” method (see
Subdivision 28-C) of deducting *car expenses you incurred for the
*car in the income year. However, the kilometres the car travelled
during the income year in the course of travel covered by the
*award transport payment or payments are not counted as *business
kilometres.

960-100 Entities
(1) Entity means any of the following:
(a) an individual;
(b) a body corporate;
(c) a body politic;
(d) a partnership;
(e) any other unincorporated association or body of persons;
(f) a trust;
(g) a *superannuation fund;
(h) an *approved deposit fund.
Note:

The term entity is used in a number of different but related senses. It
covers all kinds of legal person. It also covers groups of legal persons,
and other things, that in practice are treated as having a separate
identity in the same way as a legal person does.

(1A) Paragraph (1)(e) does not include a *non-entity joint venture.
(2) The trustee of a trust, of a *superannuation fund or of an *approved
deposit fund is taken to be an entity consisting of the person who is
the trustee, or the persons who are the trustees, at any given time.
Note 1:

This is because a right or obligation cannot be conferred or imposed
on an entity that is not a legal person.

Note 2:

The entity that is the trustee of a trust or fund does not change merely
because of a change in the person who is the trustee of the trust or
fund, or persons who are the trustees of the trust or fund.

(3) A legal person can have a number of different capacities in which
the person does things. In each of those capacities, the person is
taken to be a different entity.

Section 960-105
Example: In addition to his or her personal capacity, an individual may be:
•
sole trustee of one or more trusts; and
•
one of a number of trustees of a further trust.
In his or her personal capacity, he or she is one entity. As trustee of
each trust, he or she is a different entity. The trustees of the further
trust are a different entity again, of which the individual is a member.

(4) If a provision refers to an entity of a particular kind, it refers to the
entity in its capacity as that kind of entity, not to that entity in any
other capacity.
Example: A provision that refers to a company does not cover a company in a
capacity as trustee, unless it also refers to a trustee.
Note:

Under section 87-35, certain parts of Australian governments and
authorities are treated as separate entities for the purposes of
ascertaining whether another entity is conducting a personal services
business.

960-105 Certain entities treated as agents
(1) This Act applies to an entity as if the entity were an agent of
another entity (the principal) if:
(a) the principal is outside Australia; and
(b) the entity is in Australia and, on behalf of the principal, holds
money of the principal or has control, receipt or disposal of
money of the principal.
(2) This Act, or a provision of this Act, applies to an entity as if the
entity were an agent of another entity if the Commissioner
determines in writing that the entity is the agent or sole agent of the
other entity for the purposes of this Act or of that provision.
(3) A determination under subsection (2) is not a legislative
instrument.

are *debt interests. This subsection has effect despite
subsections (1) and (2) of this section.
Example: An entity is not a member of a company as defined in this section
merely because it is a member of the company in the ordinary sense of
the term because it holds a finance share in the company, if the
finance share is a debt interest. However, if the entity holds other
shares in the company that are not debt interests, it will be a member
because of those other shares.

960-135 Membership interest in an entity
If you are a *member of an entity:
(a) each interest, or set of interests, in the entity; or
(b) each right, or set of rights, in relation to the entity;
by virtue of which you are a member of the entity is a membership
interest of yours in the entity.
Note:

In conjunction with subsection 960-130(3), this means that a debt
interest is not a membership interest.

Example: A member of a company holds a finance share in a company that is a
debt interest and some other shares in the company that are not debt
interests. Only the other shares are membership interests in the
company. The finance share is not, because the member is not a
member of the company because of that share (see
subsection 960-130(3)).

960-140 Ordinary membership interest
A *membership interest in a *corporate tax entity is an ordinary
membership interest if:
(a) in the case of a membership interest in a company—it is an
ordinary share; and
(b) in the case of a membership interest in a *corporate limited
partnership—it is an interest in the income of the partnership;
and
(c) in the case of a membership interest in a *public trading
trust—it is a unit in the trust.

This Subdivision has 2 principles for defining family relationships.
The first principle is to treat an unmarried couple (whether of the
same sex or different sexes) in the same way as a married couple
if:
(a) their relationship is registered under particular State or
Territory laws; or
(b) they live together on a genuine domestic basis.
The second principle is to treat anyone who is defined to be an
individual’s child in the same way as the individual’s natural child
would be treated.
Both principles extend to tracing other family relationships,
including beyond couples and children and their parents.

Operative provisions
960-252 Object of this Subdivision
(1) The first object of this Subdivision is to ensure that the same
consequences flow under this Act and the other Acts to which this
Subdivision applies from the relationship between 2 people who
are an unmarried couple (whether of the same sex or different
sexes) as from a marriage, if:
(a) the relationship is registered under a *State law or *Territory
law (as mentioned in paragraph (a) of the definition of
spouse in subsection 995-1(1)); or
(b) they live together on a genuine domestic basis.
(2) The second object of this Subdivision is to ensure that under this
Act and the other Acts to which this Subdivision applies, anyone
who is defined to be an individual’s *child is treated in the same
way as if he or she were the individual’s natural child.

960-255 Family relationships
Relationships between couples
(1) If one individual is the *spouse of another individual because of the
definition of spouse in subsection 995-1(1), relationships traced to,
from or through the individual, and family groups of which either
individual is a member, are to be determined in the same way as if
the individual were legally married to the other individual.
Example: George and Angelika are not legally married but live together on a
genuine domestic basis in a relationship as a couple. This Act treats
them as part of each other’s family.

Relationships involving children
(2) If one individual is the *child of another individual because of the
definition of child in subsection 995-1(1), relationships traced to,
from or through the individual, and family groups of which either
individual is a member, are to be determined in the same way as if
the individual were the natural child of the other individual.
Example: Clare’s stepfather Frank has a sister Angela. This Act applies as if
Angela were Clare’s aunt because Clare is defined to be Frank’s child.
That is, Clare’s relationship to Angela is determined on the basis that
Clare is Frank’s natural child.

Application
(3) Subsections (1) and (2) apply for the purposes of this Act. They
also apply for the purposes of a provision of another Act if one or
more of the following applies for the purposes of that provision (or
would apply if it were used in the provision):
(a) the definition of child in subsection 995-1(1);

Sum of the *index numbers for the *quarters in the year ending on
the previous 31 March

(1A) However, for indexation of the amounts mentioned in the
provisions listed at items 5, 6 and 7 in section 960-265, the
indexation factor is:
*Index number for the *quarter ending on
31 December just before the start of the relevant income year
*Index number for the *quarter ending on the previous 31 December

(2) For indexation of the *cost base of a *CGT asset (except the first
element of the cost base of an asset covered by subsection (3)), the
indexation factor for expenditure in an element of the cost base is:
*Index
*Index

number for the *quarter ending on 30 September 1999
number for the *quarter in which the expenditure was incurred

The expenditure can include giving property: see section 103-5.
Note 1:

This rule does not apply to expenditure incurred after 11.45 am on
21 September 1999 or any expenditure relating to a CGT asset
acquired after that time: see section 114-1.

Note 2:

This rule applies even if you do not actually pay some of the
expenditure until a later time (for example, under a contract to
purchase an asset by instalments).

Note 3:

There are rules affecting when the expenditure was incurred: see
sections 114-15 and 114-20.

*Index

number for the *quarter ending on 30 September 1999
*Index number for the *quarter in which the amount was paid

The payment can include giving property: see section 103-5.
Example: Peter acquires shares in a company. The shares are partly-paid, and
the company makes a call on the shares. Peter sells the shares to
Narina before he is liable to pay the call.
The amount Narina paid to Peter for the shares is indexed under
subsection 960-275(2) from the quarter in which she incurred the
expenditure to acquire the shares.
The amount Narina later pays for the call on the shares is indexed in
accordance with subsection 960-275(3) from the quarter in which she
made that later payment.
Note 1:

This subsection does not apply to shares or units you acquired before
16 August 1989: see section 960-275 of the Income Tax (Transitional
Provisions) Act 1997.

Note 2:

This subsection does not apply to an amount paid after 11.45 am on
21 September 1999 or an amount paid in relation to a CGT asset
acquired after that time: see section 114-1.

(4) However, you cannot index expenditure in the third element of the
*cost base of a CGT asset (costs of ownership).
(5) You work out the *indexation factor to 3 decimal places (rounding
up if the fourth decimal place is 5 or more).
Example: If the factor is 1.102795, it would be rounded up to 1.103.

(6) This section does not apply in relation to amounts mentioned in the
provisions listed at items 8 to 12, or at item 14, in section 960-265.

(a) disregard any exceptions in those principles to requirements
in those principles for entities to be consolidated as a single
group; and
(b) without limiting paragraph (a), disregard any rule in those
principles providing that one or more entities (the excepted
entities) are not required to be consolidated as a single group
with one or more other entities because the effect of such
consolidation would be immaterial as a result of:
(i) the size of the excepted entities; or
(ii) any other matter.

961-5 Who is entitled to the notional tax offset
(1) You are entitled to a notional tax offset for an income year if:
(a) you are an individual; and
(b) you are an Australian resident; and
(c) during the year you contribute to the maintenance of another
individual (the dependant) who:
(i) is less than 25 years of age, and is a full-time student at
a school, college or university; or
(ii) if subparagraph (i) does not apply—is less than 21 years

974-1 What this Division is about
This Division tells you whether an interest is a debt interest, or an
equity interest, for tax purposes. An interest that could be
characterised as both a debt interest and an equity interest will be
treated as a debt interest for tax purposes (except for certain
interests that fund returns on equity interests).
Whether an interest is a debt interest or an equity interest matters
because returns on debt interests are not frankable but may be
deductible while returns on equity interests are not deductible but
may be frankable.
This Division extends beyond shares the range of interests that are
recognised as equity in a company. An interest that is an equity
interest in a company but is not a share will be treated in the same
way as a share for some tax purposes (particularly in relation to the
determination of the tax treatment of returns on the interest).

non-share dividends and which will be non-share capital returns.
Those that are non-share dividends will be treated, for most tax
purposes, in the same way as dividends.

974-5 Overview of Division
Test for distinguishing debt and equity interests
(1) The test for distinguishing between debt interests and equity
interests focuses on economic substance rather than mere legal
form (see subsection 974-10(2)). The test is designed to assess the
economic substance of an interest in terms of its impact on the
issuer’s position.
Debt interests
(2) Subdivision 974-B tells you when an interest is a debt interest in an
entity. The basic test is in section 974-20.
Equity interests
(3) Subdivision 974-C tells you when an interest is an equity interest
in a company. The basic test is in section 974-75.
Tie breaker between debt and equity
(4) If an interest satisfies both the debt test and the equity test, it is
treated as a debt interest and not an equity interest.

Distributions in relation to equity interests that are not shares
(5) If you have an equity interest in a company that is not a share,
Subdivision 974-E tells you what will count as a non-share
distribution, a non-share dividend and a non-share capital return in
relation to the interest.
Concepts used in the debt and equity tests
(6) Subdivision 974-F defines a number of concepts that are used in
the debt and equity tests (financing arrangement, effectively
non-contingent obligation, benchmark rate of return and converting
interest).

Operative provisions
974-10 Object
(1) An object of this Division is to establish a test for determining for
particular tax purposes whether a *scheme, or the combined
operation of a number of schemes:
(a) gives rise to a *debt interest; or
(b) gives rise to an *equity interest.
Note 1:

The test is used, for example, for:
(a) identifying distributions that may be frankable and which may be
subject to dividend withholding tax; and
(b) identifying returns that may be deductible to the company
making the return; and
(c) resolving uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment for
debt/equity hybrid interests (interests that have some debt
qualities and some equity qualities); and
(d) identifying debt capital for the purposes of Division 820 (thin
capitalisation rules).

Note 2:

Subdivision 167-A has special rules for working out rights to
dividends and capital distributions in a company whose shares do not
all carry the same rights to those matters. Those rules include
disregarding debt interests.

(2) Another object of this Division is that the test referred to in
subsection (1) is to operate on the basis of the economic substance

Section 974-10
of the rights and obligations arising under the *scheme or schemes
rather than merely on the basis of the legal form of the scheme or
schemes.
Note 1:

The basic indicator of the economic character of a debt interest is the
non-contingent nature of the returns. The basic indicator of the
economic character of an equity interest, on the other hand, is the
contingent nature of the returns (or convertibility into an interest of
that nature).

Note 2:

The test is intended to operate, for example, to:
(a) deny deductibility (but allow franking) for “interest” in relation
to a scheme that has the legal form of a loan if the economic
substance of the rights and obligations arising under the relevant
scheme gives the interest characteristics that are the same as or
similar to those of a dividend on an ordinary share (and thereby
prevent deductible returns on equity); and
(b) allow a deduction (but not franking) for a “dividend” in relation
to a scheme that has the legal form of an ordinary share if the
economic substance of the rights and obligations arising under
the relevant scheme gives the dividend characteristics that are the
same as or similar to those of deductible interest on an ordinary
loan (and thereby prevent frankable returns on debt).
This will not happen if a provision in this Act specifically provides for
a different treatment for the interest or dividend.

(3) Another object of this Division is that the combined effect of
*related schemes be taken into account in appropriate cases:
(a) to ensure that the test operates effectively on the basis of the
economic substance of the rights and obligations arising
under the schemes rather than merely on the basis of the legal
form of the schemes; and
(b) to prevent the test being circumvented by entities merely
entering into a number of separate schemes instead of a
single scheme.
(4) Another object of this Division is to identify the distributions and
credits made in respect of *non-share equity interests in a company
that are to be treated as *dividends (non-share dividends) and
those that are to be treated as returns of capital (non-share capital
returns).

Single scheme giving rise to debt interest
(1) A *scheme gives rise to a debt interest in an entity if the scheme,
when it comes into existence, satisfies the debt test in
subsection 974-20(1) in relation to the entity.
Note 1:

A debt interest can also arise under subsection (2) (related schemes) or
section 974-65 (Commissioner’s discretion).

Note 2:

Section 974-55 defines various aspects of the debt interest that arises.

Related schemes giving rise to debt interest
(2) Two or more *related schemes (the constituent schemes) together
give rise to a debt interest in an entity if:
(a) the entity enters into, participates in or causes another entity
to enter into or participate in the constituent schemes; and
(b) a scheme with the combined effect or operation of the
constituent schemes (the notional scheme) would satisfy the
debt test in subsection 974-20(1) in relation to the entity if
the notional scheme came into existence when the last of the
constituent schemes came into existence; and
(c) it is reasonable to conclude that the entity intended, or knew
that a party to the scheme or one of the schemes intended, the
combined economic effects of the constituent schemes to be
the same as, or similar to, the economic effects of a debt
interest.
This is so whether or not the constituent schemes come into
existence at the same time and even if none of the constituent

an entity under subsection (2) if the Commissioner determines that
it would be unreasonable to apply that subsection to those schemes.

(b) the effects of the schemes (considered both individually and

(b) the entity, or a *connected entity of the entity, receives, or
will receive, a *financial benefit or benefits under the

entity each has, an *effectively non-contingent obligation
under the scheme to provide a financial benefit or benefits to
one or more entities after the time when:
(i) the financial benefit referred to in paragraph (b) is
received if there is only one; or
(ii) the first of the financial benefits referred to in
paragraph (b) is received if there are more than one; and
(d) it is substantially more likely than not that the value provided
(worked out under subsection (2)) will be at least equal to the
value received (worked out under subsection (3)); and
(e) the value provided (worked out under subsection (2)) and the

Value in nominal terms or present value terms
(1) For the purposes of this Subdivision:
(a) the value of a *financial benefit received or provided under a
*scheme is its value calculated:
(i) in nominal terms if the performance period (see
subsection (3)) must end no later than 10 years after the
interest arising from the scheme is issued; or
(ii) in present value terms (see section 974-50) if the
performance period must or may end more than 10
years after the interest arising from the scheme is
issued; and
(b) the regulations may make provisions relating to the valuation
of a financial benefit.
Assume scheme runs its full term
(2) The value of a *financial benefit received or provided under a
*scheme is calculated assuming that the interest arising from the
scheme will continue to be held for the rest of its life.
Note 1:

Section 974-40 makes specific provision for cases in which there is a
right or option to terminate the interest early.

Note 2:

Section 974-45 makes specific provision for cases involving
convertible interests.

Performance period
(3) The performance period is the period within which, under the
terms on which the interest is issued, the *effectively
non-contingent obligations of the issuer, and any *connected entity
of the issuer, to provide a *financial benefit in relation to the

has an *effectively non-contingent obligation to terminate the
interest within that 10 year period even if the terms on which the
interest is issued formally allow the obligation to continue after the
end of that 10 year period.
Benefit dependent on variable factor
(5) If:
(a) a *financial benefit received or provided in respect of an
interest depends on a factor that may vary over time (such as
a variable interest rate); and
(b) that factor is one commonly used in commercial
arrangements; and
(c) it would be unreasonable to expect any of the parties to the
*scheme to know, or to anticipate accurately, the future value
of that factor; and
(d) that factor has a particular value (the starting value) when
the scheme is entered into;
the value of the financial benefit is calculated assuming that the
factor’s value will retain the starting value for the whole of the life
of the scheme.
Note:

For example, the value of a return based on a floating interest rate is
calculated on the basis that the interest rate remains the interest rate
that is applicable when the scheme is entered into.

Scheme wholly in foreign currency etc.
(6) If all the *financial benefits provided and received under a *scheme
are denominated in a particular foreign currency or in terms of

Section 974-40
974-40 Valuation of financial benefits—rights and options to
terminate early
(1) This section deals with the situation in which a party to a *scheme
has a right or option to terminate the scheme early (whether by
discharging an obligation early, converting the interest arising from
the scheme into another interest or otherwise).
Note 1:

An example of terminating a scheme early by discharging an
obligation early is terminating a loan by discharging the obligation to
repay the principal (and any outstanding interest) early.

Note 2:

In certain circumstances, conversion of an interest into another interest
can terminate its life (see section 974-45).

(2) The existence of the right or option is to be disregarded in working
out the length of the life of the interest arising from the *scheme for
the purposes of this Subdivision if the party does not have an
*effectively non-contingent obligation to exercise the right or
option.
(3) If the party does have an *effectively non-contingent obligation to
exercise the right or option, the life of the interest ends at the
earliest time at which the party will have to exercise the right or
option.
(4) This section does not limit subsection 974-35(2).

(1) Subject to the regulations made for the purposes of subsection (5),
the value in present value terms of a *financial benefit to be
provided or received in respect of an interest (the test interest) is
calculated under subsection (4).
(2) If you need to calculate the values in present value terms of a
number of *financial benefits, the value of each financial benefit is
to be calculated separately.
(3) The value of a *financial benefit is to be calculated assuming that
all amounts to be paid by an entity in respect of the test interest are

n is the number of years in the period starting on the day on which
the test interest is issued and ending on the day on which the
*financial benefit is to be provided. If the period includes a part of
a year, that part is to be expressed as the fraction:
Number of days in that period
Number of days in the year

year means a period of 12 months.

(a) consists of the interest that carries the right to receive a
*financial benefit that the entity or a *connected entity has an
*effectively non-contingent obligation to provide under the
scheme or any of the schemes; and
(b) is taken, subject to section 974-60, to be a debt interest in the

(c) is taken to be issued by the entity; and
(d) is issued when the entity (or a connected entity of the entity)
first receives a *financial benefit under the scheme or any of

Note:

A scheme may give rise to the same debt interest in 2 or more entities

Step 1.

Work out, for each of the entities, the total value of the
*financial benefits that the entity is under an *effectively
non-contingent obligation to provide under the *scheme

Step 2.

The *debt interest is taken to be a debt interest in the
entity with the greatest obligation value.

Step 3.

If it is not possible to determine which entity has the
greatest obligation value (whether because of an equality
of, or uncertainty as to, obligation values or otherwise),
the *debt interest is taken to be a debt interest in the
entity agreed on by all the entities.

Step 4.

If the entities do not agree, the interest is taken to be a

Section 974-70
(a) the scheme satisfies the equity test in subsection 974-75(1) in
relation to the company because of the existence of an
interest; and
(b) the interest is not characterised as, and does not form part of
a larger interest that is characterised as, a *debt interest in the
company, or a *connected entity of the company, under
Subdivision 974-B.
Note 1:

An equity interest can also arise under subsection (2) if a notional
scheme with the combined effect of a number of related schemes
would give rise to an equity interest under this subsection. To do this,
the notional scheme would need to satisfy paragraph (b). This means
that the related schemes will not give rise to an equity interest if the
notional scheme would be characterised as (or form part of a larger
interest that would be characterised as) a debt interest in the company
or a connected entity.

Note 2:

An equity interest can also arise under section 974-80 (arrangements
for funding return through connected entities).

Note 3:

Section 974-95 defines various aspects of the equity interest that
arises.

Related schemes giving rise to equity interest
(2) Two or more *related schemes (the constituent schemes) are taken
together to give rise to an equity interest in a company if:
(a) the company enters into, participates in or causes another
entity to enter into or participate in the constituent schemes;
and
(b) a scheme with the combined effect or operation of the
constituent schemes (the notional scheme) would give rise to
an *equity interest in the company under subsection (1) if the
notional scheme came into existence when the last of the
constituent schemes came into existence; and
(c) it is reasonable to conclude that the company intended, or
knew that a party to the scheme or one of the schemes
intended, the combined economic effects of the constituent
schemes to be the same as, or similar to, the economic effects
of an equity interest.

the result that subsection (4) of this section produces in
relation to the arrangement; but
(b) for the purpose of applying this Division in relation to the
arrangement after subsection (4) of this section has ceased to
have effect, that subsection of section 974-110 is taken to
have produced the result that it would have produced if
subsection (4) of this section had not applied to the
arrangement.
Further exception for certain related party at call loans
(6) In applying this Division in relation to a particular *scheme and a
particular income year (which may be the income year in which the
scheme is entered into or a later income year), the scheme is taken
not to give rise to an equity interest in a company, and instead to
give rise to a debt interest in the company, if:
(a) the scheme takes the form of a loan to the company that
satisfies paragraphs (4)(a), (b) and (c); and
(b) the company’s *GST turnover (worked out at the end of the
income year) is less than $20,000,000.
Note:

If this subsection does not apply in relation to the previous income
year or the next income year, and the scheme gives rise to an equity
interest according to the other provisions of this Division, an
adjustment to the company’s non-share capital account will occur at
the end of the previous income year or the start of the next income
year (see subsections 164-15(2) and 164-20(3)).

(7) For the purpose of paragraph (6)(b), the question whether a
company’s *GST turnover (worked out at the end of an income
year) is less than $20,000,000 is to be determined in accordance
with subsection 188-10(2) of the *GST Act, as if that amount of
$20,000,000 were a turnover threshold for the purposes of that
subsection of the GST Act.

974-80 Equity interest arising from arrangement funding return
through connected entities
(1) This section deals with the situation in which:
(a) an interest carries a right to a variable or fixed return from a
company; and
(b) the interest is held by a *connected entity of the company;
and
(c) apart from this section, the interest would not be an *equity
interest in the company; and
(ca) the *scheme that gives rise to the interest is a *financing
arrangement for the company; and
(d) there is a scheme, or a series of schemes, designed to operate
so that the return to the connected entity is to be used to fund
(directly or indirectly) a return to another person (the
ultimate recipient).
(2) The interest is an equity interest in the company if:
(a) the amount of the return to the ultimate recipient is in
substance or effect *contingent on aspects of the economic
performance (whether past, current or future) of:
(i) the company; or
(ii) a part of the company’s activities; or
(iii) a *connected entity of the company or a part of the
activities of a connected entity of the company; or
(b) either the right itself, or the amount of the return to the
ultimate recipient, is at the discretion of:

(c) the interest in respect of which the return to the ultimate
recipient is made or another interest that arises from the
scheme, or any of the schemes, referred to in
paragraph (1)(d):
(i) gives the ultimate recipient (or a connected entity of the
ultimate recipient) a right to be issued with an *equity
interest in the company or a connected entity of the
company; or
(ii) is an *interest that will, or may, convert into an equity
interest in the company or a connected entity of the
company;
and if the interest does not form part of a larger interest that is
characterised as a *debt interest in the entity in which it is held, or a
*connected entity, under Subdivision 974-B. The return may be a
return of an amount invested in the interest.
Note 1:

Section 974-90 allows regulations to be made clarifying when a right
or return is taken to be at the discretion of a company or connected
entity.

Note 2:

Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) parallel items 2, 3 and 4 of the table in
subsection 974-75(1).

Example: Company A, Company B1, Company B2 and Company B3 are
connected entities.
Company B1 operates Trust Fund C. An interest in Trust Fund C is
issued to person H and the return on that interest is contingent on
aspects of the economic performance of Company A.
Trust Fund C lends the money paid by H for the purchase of the
interest to Company B1 which lends the money to Company B2 which
lends the money to Company B3 which lends the money to Company
A.
Under the arrangements under which the interest is issued and the
loans made, payments of interest by Company A on the loan that
Company B3 makes to Company A are intended to pass back through
Company B2 and Company B1 to fund the return on H’s interest in
Trust Fund C.
Under subsection (2), Company B3 will have an equity interest in
Company A. If the return to Company B3 were itself contingent on
Company A’s performance, Company B3’s interest would be an

subsection 974-75(1) (and not under subsection (2) of this section).
Company B2 has an equity interest in Company B3 and Company B1
has an equity interest in Company B2. This is because the returns they
get are intended to fund the return on H’s interest in Trust Fund C and
that return is contingent on aspects of the economic performance of
Company A (which is related to both Company B3 and Company B2).

(3) The interest referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (2)(c) may take the
form of a proprietary right, a chose in action or any other form.

974-85 Right or return contingent on aspects of economic
performance
(1) A right, or the amount of a return, is contingent on aspects of the
economic performance of an entity, or a part of the entity’s
activities, if the right or return is contingent on the economic
performance of that entity, or that part of those activities, but not
solely because of one of the following:
(a) the ability or willingness of an entity to meet the obligation
to satisfy the right to the return;
(b) the receipts or turnover of the entity or the turnover generated
by those activities.
(2) The regulations may specify circumstances in which a right or
return is to be taken to be contingent, or not contingent, on aspects
of the economic performance of an entity or a part of an entity’s
activities.
(3) The regulations may provide that paragraph (1)(b) does not apply

company or a *connected entity of the company.

974-95 The equity interest
(1) If a *scheme gives rise to an *equity interest in a company because
of an item of the table in subsection 974-75(1), the equity interest
consists of the interest referred to in that item.
(2) If 2 or more *related schemes give rise to an *equity interest in a
company because of an item of the table in subsection 974-75(1),
the equity interest consists of the combination of interests under the

Example: Company A issues a convertible note to Company B. Company C, a
connected entity of Company B, provides a binding collateral
undertaking to Company A that Company B will exercise the option
to convert the note into shares in Company A. The convertible note
and the undertaking are related schemes that may give rise to an
equity interest in Company A if their combined effect satisfies
section 974-70. If so, the returns on the note are taken to be returns in
respect of the equity interest.

an expression whose meaning is given by this Division.

(b) the scheme, or one or more of the schemes, are subsequently
changed, including where one or more (but not all) of the

(b) specify circumstances in which a scheme will not be a

974-135 Effectively non-contingent obligation
(1) There is an effectively non-contingent obligation to take an action
under a *scheme if, having regard to the pricing, terms and
conditions of the scheme, there is in substance or effect a
non-contingent obligation (see subsections (3), (4) and (6)) to take
that action.
(2) Without limiting subsection (1), that subsection applies to:
(a) providing a *financial benefit under the *scheme; or
(b) terminating the scheme.
(3) An obligation is non-contingent if it is not contingent on any
event, condition or situation (including the economic performance
of the entity having the obligation or a *connected entity of that
entity), other than the ability or willingness of that entity or
connected entity to meet the obligation.
(4) The existence of the right of the holder of an *interest that will or
may convert into an *equity interest in a company to convert the
interest does not of itself make the issuer’s obligation to repay the
investment not non-contingent.
(5) An obligation to redeem a preference share is not contingent
merely because there is a legislative requirement for the
redemption amount to be met out of profits or a fresh issue of
*equity interests.
(6) In determining whether there is in substance or effect a
non-contingent obligation to take the action, have regard to the
artificiality, or the contrived nature, of any contingency on which
the obligation to take the action depends.

Note:

The artificiality, or the contrived nature, of a contingency would tend
to indicate that there is, in substance or effect, a non-contingent
obligation to take that action.

(7) An obligation of yours is not effectively non-contingent merely
because you will suffer some detrimental practical or commercial
consequences if you do not fulfil the obligation.
Note:

For example, a contingent obligation to make payments in respect of
an income security issued by an approved deposit-taking institution
(ADI) is not effectively non-contingent merely because of the
detrimental effect non-payment would have on the ADI’s business.

(8) The regulations may make further provisions relating to the
following:
(a) what constitutes a non-contingent obligation;
(b) what does not constitute a non-contingent obligation;
(c) what constitutes an *effectively non-contingent obligation;
(d) what does not constitute an effectively non-contingent
obligation.

974-140 Ordinary debt interest
(1) A *debt interest arising from a scheme is an ordinary debt interest
if none of the obligations under the scheme is in substance or effect
*contingent on aspects of the economic performance of:
(a) the issuer of the interest; or
(b) a *connected entity; or
(c) a part of the operations of the issuer or a connected entity.
(2) The regulations may specify rules for determining whether a *debt
interest is an *ordinary debt interest.

(a) the first entity has an *associate-inclusive control interest in
the company of at least 50%; or
(b) the first entity has an associate-inclusive control interest in

(e) section 354 applies as if it referred to partnerships rather than

(f) section 355 applies as if it referred to trusts rather than
CFT’s.
Note 1:

Part X of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 defines company to
exclude a company in the capacity of a trustee.

Note 2:

The terms direct control interest and control tracing interest are
relevant to working out associate-inclusive control interests in a
company: see sections 350, 351, 353, 354 and 355 of that Act.

Note 3:

Under subsection 349(4) of that Act, if 2 or more entities would have
a direct control interest or a control tracing interest in a company or
trust equal to 100%, only one of them holds the interest.

Note 4:

Subsections 350(6) and (7) of that Act deal with direct control
interests in a company. They deal with interests held by Australian
entities. Under subsection 355(1), certain entities are taken to hold a
control tracing interest in a trust equal to 100%.

Note 5:

Paragraphs (2)(d), (e) and (f) of this section are necessary because
