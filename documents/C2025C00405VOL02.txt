40-1 What this Division is about
You can deduct an amount equal to the decline in value of a
depreciating asset (an asset that has a limited effective life and that
is reasonably expected to decline in value over the time it is used)
that you hold.
That decline is generally measured by reference to the effective life
of the asset.
You can also deduct amounts for certain other capital expenditure.

Provisions

1.1

Core provisions
Depreciating assets are assets with a limited effective
life that are reasonably expected to decline in value.
Broadly, the effective life of a depreciating asset is the
period it can be used to produce income.
The decline in value is based on the cost and effective
life of the depreciating asset, not its actual change in
value. It begins at start time, when you begin to use the
asset (or when you have it installed ready for use). It
continues while you use the asset (or have it installed).

Subdivision 40-B

Usually, the owner of a depreciating asset holds the
asset and can therefore claim deductions for its decline
in value. Sometimes the economic owner will be
different to the legal owner and the economic owner
will be the holder.
1.2

Cost
The cost of a depreciating asset includes both:
•

expenses you incur to start holding the asset; and

•

additional expenses that contribute to its present
condition and location (e.g. improvements).

Subdivision 40-C

1.3

Balancing adjustments
When you stop holding a depreciating asset you may
have to include an amount in your assessable income,
or deduct an amount under a balancing adjustment.
The adjustment reconciles the decline with the actual
change in value.

Subdivision 40-D

1.4

Low-value and software development pools
Low-cost assets and assets depreciated to a low value
may be placed in a low value pool, which is treated as a
single depreciating asset. You can also pool in-house
software expenditure in a software development pool.

40-25 Deducting amounts for depreciating assets
You deduct the decline in value
(1) You can deduct an amount equal to the decline in value for an
income year (as worked out under this Division) of a *depreciating
asset that you *held for any time during the year.
Note 1:

Sections 40-70, 40-72 and 40-75 show you how to work out the
decline for most depreciating assets. There is a limit on the decline:
see subsections 40-70(3), 40-72(3) and 40-75(7).

Note 2:

Small business entities can choose to both deduct and work out the
amount they can deduct under Division 328.

Note 3:

Generally, only one taxpayer can deduct amounts for a depreciating
asset. However, if you and another taxpayer jointly hold the asset,
each of you deduct amounts for it: see section 40-35.

Reduction of deduction
(2) You must reduce your deduction by the part of the asset’s decline
in value that is attributable to your use of the asset, or your having
it *installed ready for use, for a purpose other than a *taxable
purpose.
Example: Ben holds a depreciating asset that he uses for private purposes for
30% of his total use in the income year.
If the asset declines by $1,000 for the year, Ben would have to reduce
his deduction by $300 (30% of $1,000).

Section 40-25
Note:

You may have to make a further reduction under subsections (3) and
(4) or section 40-27.

Further reduction: leisure facilities
(3) You may have to make a further reduction for a *depreciating
asset that is a *leisure facility attributable to your use of it, or
your having it *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose.
(4) That reduction is the part of the *leisure facility’s decline in value
that is attributable to your use of it, or your having it *installed
ready for use, at a time when:
(a) its use did not constitute a *fringe benefit; or
(b) you did not use it or *hold it for use as mentioned in
paragraph 26-50(3)(b) (about using it in the course of your
business or for your employees).
Exception: low-value pools
(5) Subsections (2), (3) and (4) do not apply to *depreciating assets
allocated to a low-value pool.
Despite subsection (1), you can continue to deduct an amount
equal to the decline in value for an income year (as worked out
under this Division) of such an asset even though you do not
continue to *hold that asset.
Note:

See Subdivision 40-E for low-value pools.

Meaning of taxable purpose
(7) Subject to subsection (8), a taxable purpose is:
(a) the *purpose of producing assessable income; or
(b) the purpose of *exploration or prospecting; or
(c) the purpose of *mining site rehabilitation; or
(d) *environmental protection activities.
Note 1:

Where you have had a deduction under this Division an amount may
be included in your assessable income if the expenditure was financed
by limited recourse debt that has terminated: see Division 243.

Section 40-27
Note 2:

When this Division notionally applies under section 355-310 (about
depreciating assets used for R&D activities), the taxable purpose is
sometimes only the purpose of conducting R&D activities.

(8) If Division 250 applies to you and an asset that is a *depreciating
asset:
(a) if section 250-150 applies—you are taken not to be using the
asset for a *taxable purpose to the extent of the *disallowed
capital allowance percentage; or
(b) otherwise—you are taken not to be using the asset for such a
purpose.

40-27 Further reduction of deduction for second-hand assets in
residential property
(1) In addition to subsections 40-25(2) to (4), you may have to further
reduce your deduction for a *depreciating asset for the income
year.
(2) Reduce your deduction by any part of the asset’s decline in value
that is attributable to your use of it, or your having it *installed
ready for use, for the *purpose of producing assessable income:
(a) from the use of *residential premises to provide residential
accommodation; but
(b) not in the course of carrying on a *business;
if:
(c) you did not *hold the asset when it was first used, or first
installed ready for use, (other than as trading stock) by any
entity; or
(d) at any time during the income year or an earlier income year,
the asset was used, or installed ready for use, either:
(i) in residential premises that were one of your residences
at that time; or
(ii) for a purpose that was not a *taxable purpose, and in a
way that was not occasional.

Section 40-27
Note:

Your deduction could be reduced to nil if the purpose to which
paragraphs (a) and (b) relate is your only taxable purpose for using the
asset or having the asset installed ready for use.

Exception—kind of entity
(3) Subsection (2) does not apply to you for the asset if, at any time
during the income year, you are:
(a) a *corporate tax entity; or
(b) a *superannuation plan that is not a *self managed
superannuation fund; or
(c) a *managed investment trust; or
(d) a public unit trust (within the meaning of section 102P of the

Exception—certain assets in new residential premises
(4) Paragraph (2)(c) does not apply to you for the asset if:
(a) the *residential premises referred to in paragraph (2)(a) (the
current premises) are supplied to you as new residential
premises on a particular day (the current supply day); and
(b) the asset is supplied to you as part of that supply of the
current premises; and
(c) at the time you first *hold the asset as a result of that supply,

Note:

An entity residing at an earlier time in other residential premises in the
same complex will not cause paragraph (d) to prevent this subsection

(5) However, disregard paragraph (4)(d) for an earlier time if:
(a) the asset was used, or installed ready for use, in the current

(1) A depreciating asset is an asset that has a limited *effective life
and can reasonably be expected to decline in value over the time it
is used, except:
(a) land; or
(b) an item of *trading stock; or
(c) an intangible asset, unless it is mentioned in subsection (2).
(2) These intangible assets are depreciating assets if they are not
*trading stock:
(a) *mining, quarrying or prospecting rights;
(b) *mining, quarrying or prospecting information;

(h) *telecommunications site access rights.
(3) This Division applies to an improvement to land, or a fixture on
land, whether the improvement or fixture is removable or not, as if
it were an asset separate from the land.
Note 1:

Whether such an asset is a depreciating asset depends on whether it
falls within the definition in subsection (1).

Note 2:

This Division does not apply to capital works for which you can
deduct amounts under Division 43: see subsection 40-45(2).

(4) Whether a particular composite item is itself a depreciating asset
or whether its components are separate depreciating assets is a
question of fact and degree which can only be determined in the
light of all the circumstances of the particular case.
Example 1: A car is made up of many separate components, but usually the car is
a depreciating asset rather than each component.
Example 2: A floating restaurant consists of many separate components (like the
ship itself, stoves, fridges, furniture, crockery and cutlery), but usually
these components are treated as separate depreciating assets.

(5) This Division applies to a renewal or extension of a *depreciating
asset that is a right as if the renewal or extension were a
continuation of the original right.
(6) This Division applies to a *mining, quarrying or prospecting right
(the new right) as if it were a continuation of another mining,
quarrying or prospecting right you *held if:
(a) the other right ends; and
(b) any of the following conditions are satisfied:
(i) the new right and the other right relate to the same area,
or any difference in area is not significant;
(ii) the new right relates to an area that is a part of the area
that the other right relates to.
Note:

If the other right does not end, it may be taken to be split into 2 assets:
see section 40-122.

Section 40-35
(7) For the purposes of subsection (6), it does not matter whether the
new right begins immediately after the other right ends or later
(including in a later income year).

40-35 Jointly held depreciating assets
(1) This Division and the provisions referred to in subsection (3) apply
to a *depreciating asset (the underlying asset) that you *hold, and
that is also held by one or more other entities, as if your interest in
the underlying asset were itself the underlying asset.
Note:

Partners do not hold partnership assets: see section 40-40.

(2) As a result, the decline in value of the underlying asset is not itself
taken into account.
Example: Buford Corp owns an office block that it leases to 2 companies,
Smokey Pty Ltd and Bandit Pty Ltd. Smokey and Bandit decide to
install a fountain in front of the building.
They discuss it with Buford who agrees to pay half the cost (because
the fountain won’t be removable at the end of the lease). Smokey and
Bandit split the rest of the cost between them.
Smokey and Bandit would each hold the asset under item 3 of the
table in section 40-40 and Buford would hold it under item 10. They
would be joint holders, so each would write-off its interest in the
fountain.

(3) The provisions are:
(a) Divisions 41, 328 and 775 of this Act; and
(b) Divisions 40 and 328 of the Income Tax (Transitional
Provisions) Act 1997.

40-40 Meaning of hold a depreciating asset
Use this table to work out who holds a *depreciating asset. An
entity identified in column 3 of an item in the table as not holding
a depreciating asset cannot hold the asset under another item.

Section 40-42
Example 1: Power Finance leases a luxury car to Kris who subleases it to Rachael.
As lessee, item 1 makes Rachael the holder of the car. Power, as the
legal owner, would normally hold the car under item 10.
However, item 1 makes it clear that Power, as lessor, does not hold the
car. As the lessee, item 1 would normally mean that Kris held the car
but, again, she is also a lessor and so is not the holder (she also
doesn’t have the right to use the car during the sublease).
Example 2: Sandra sells a packing machine to Jenny under a hire purchase
agreement. Jenny holds the machine under item 6 because, although
she is not the legal owner until she exercises her option to purchase,
she possesses the machine now and can exercise an option to become
its legal owner.
Jenny is reasonably expected to exercise that option because the final
payment will be well below the expected market value of the machine
at the end of the agreement. Sandra, as the machine’s legal owner,
would normally be its holder under item 10 but item 6 makes it clear
that the legal owner is not the holder.
Note 1:

Some assets may have holders under more than one item in the table.

Note 2:

As well as hire purchase agreements, items 5 and 6 cover cases like
assets subject to chattel mortgages, sales subject to retention of title
clauses and assets subject to bare trusts.

40-42 When mining, quarrying or prospecting rights are used
(1) This Division and Subdivision 328-D (capital allowances for small

*mining, quarrying or prospecting right as if a reference to using
the asset were a reference to engaging in activity that involves
exercising rights conferred on you by the asset.
(2) If the asset is an interest covered by paragraph (c) of the definition
of mining, quarrying or prospecting right in subsection 995-1(1),
the reference in subsection (1) of this section to rights conferred on
you by the asset is taken to be a reference to rights conferred on

Section 40-60
Note:

See Subdivision 28-C for that method.

40-60 When a depreciating asset starts to decline in value
(1) A *depreciating asset you *hold starts to decline in value from
when its *start time occurs.
(2) The start time of a *depreciating asset is when you first use it, or
have it *installed ready for use, for any purpose.
Note:

Previous use by a transition entity is ignored: see section 58-70.

(3) However, there is another start time for a *depreciating asset you
*hold if a *balancing adjustment event referred to in
paragraph 40-295(1)(b) occurs for the asset and you start to use the
asset again. Its second start time is when you start using it again.

40-65 Choice of methods to work out the decline in value
(1) You have a choice of 2 methods to work out the decline in value of
a *depreciating asset. You must choose to use either the
*diminishing value method or the *prime cost method.
Note 1:

Once you make the choice for an asset, you cannot change it: see
section 40-130.

Note 2:

For the diminishing value method, see sections 40-70 and 40-72. For
the prime cost method, see section 40-75.

Note 3:

In some cases you do not have to make the choice because you can
deduct the asset’s cost: see sections 40-80 and 40-82.

Note 4:

Subdivisions 40-BA and 40-BB of the Income Tax (Transitional
Provisions) Act 1997 may affect the operation of this section.

Exception: asset acquired from associate
(2) For a *depreciating asset that you acquire from an *associate of
yours where the associate has deducted or can deduct an amount
for the asset under this Division, you must use the same method
that the associate was using.
Note:

You can require the associate to tell you which method the associate
was using: see section 40-140.

Section 40-65
Exception: holder changes but user same or associate of former
user
(3) For a *depreciating asset that you acquire from a former *holder of
the asset, you must use the same method that the former holder was
using for the asset if:
(a) the former holder or another entity (each of which is the
former user) was using the asset at a time before you became
the holder; and
(b) while you hold the asset, the former user or an *associate of
the former user uses the asset.
(4) However, you must use the *diminishing value method if:
(a) you do not know, and cannot readily find out, which method
the former holder was using; or
(b) the former holder did not use a method.
Exception: low-value pools
(5) You work out the decline in value of a *depreciating asset in a
low-value pool under Subdivision 40-E rather than under this
Subdivision.
Exception: also notionally deductible under R&D provisions
(6) If:
(a) only one of the following events has happened:
(i) you have deducted one or more amounts under this
Division for an asset;
(ii) you have been entitled under section 355-100 (about
R&D) to one or more *tax offsets because you can
deduct one or more amounts under section 355-305 for
an asset; but
(b) later, the other event happens for the asset;
then, for the purposes of working out the deduction for the later
event, you must choose the same method that you chose for the
first event.

Section 40-70
Note 1:

Deductions under section 355-305 (about decline in value of tangible
depreciating assets used for R&D activities) are worked out using a
notional application of this Division.

Note 2:

This subsection applies with changes if you have or could have
deducted an amount under former section 73BA of the Income Tax
Assessment Act 1936 for the asset (see section 40-67 of the Income
Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997).

(7) If:
(a) the events in paragraph (6)(a) could both arise for the same
period for an asset; and
(b) neither event has already arisen for the asset;
then you must choose the same method for the purposes of
working out the deduction for each event.

40-70 Diminishing value method
(1) You work out the decline in value of a *depreciating asset for an
income year using the diminishing value method in this way:
Base value 

Days held
150%

365
Asset’s * effective life

where:
base value is:
(a) for the income year in which the asset’s *start time occurs—
its *cost; or
(b) for a later year—the sum of its *opening adjustable value for
that year and any amount included in the second element of
its cost for that year.
days held is the number of days you *held the asset in the income
year from its *start time, ignoring any days in that year when you
did not use the asset, or have it *installed ready for use, for any
purpose.
Note 1:

If you recalculate the effective life of a depreciating asset, you use that
recalculated life in working out your deduction.

(2) However, you must adjust the formula in subsection (1) for an
income year (the change year):
(a) for which you recalculate the *depreciating asset’s *effective
life; or
(b) after the year in which the asset’s start time occurs and in

Section 40-100
40-100 Commissioner’s determination of effective life
(1) The Commissioner may make a written determination specifying
the effective life of *depreciating assets. The determination may
specify conditions for particular depreciating assets.
(2) A determination may specify a day from which it takes effect for
*depreciating assets specified in the determination.
(3) A determination may operate retrospectively to a day specified in
the determination if:
(a) there was no applicable determination at that day for the
*depreciating asset covered by the determination; or
(b) the determination specifies a shorter *effective life for the
depreciating asset covered by the determination than was
previously applicable.
Criteria for making a determination
(4) The Commissioner is to make a determination of the effective life
of a *depreciating asset in accordance with subsections (5) and (6).
(5) Firstly, estimate the period (in years, including fractions of years)
the asset can be used by any entity for one or more of the following
purposes:
(a) a *taxable purpose;
(b) the purpose of producing *exempt income or *non-assessable
non-exempt income;
(c) the purpose of conducting *R&D activities, assuming that
this is reasonably likely.
(6) Secondly, if relevant for the asset:
(a) assume the asset will be subject to wear and tear at a rate that
is reasonable for the Commissioner to assume; and
(b) assume the asset will be maintained in reasonably good order
and condition; and
(c) have regard to the period within which the asset is likely to
be scrapped, sold for no more than scrap value or abandoned.

However, for paragraph (c), disregard reasons attributable to the
technical risk in conducting *R&D activities if it is reasonably
likely that the asset will be used for such activities.

40-102 Capped life of certain depreciating assets
(1) If this section applies to a *depreciating asset, the effective life of
the asset is the period (the capped life) that applies to the asset
under subsection (4) or (5) at the relevant time (which is worked
out using subsection (3)).
Working out if this section applies
(2) This section applies to a *depreciating asset if:
(a) you choose, under paragraph 40-95(1)(a), to use an *effective
life determined by the Commissioner for the asset under
section 40-100; and
(b) your choice is limited to a determination in force at the time
mentioned in paragraph 40-95(2)(a) or (c); and
(c) a *capped life applies to the asset under subsection (4) or (5)
at the relevant time (which is worked out using
subsection (3)); and
(d) the capped life is shorter than the effective life mentioned in
paragraph (a).
(3) For the purposes of this section, the relevant time is:
(a) the *start time of the *depreciating asset if:
(i) paragraph 40-95(2)(c) applies to you; or
(ii) paragraph 40-95(2)(a) applies to you and a *capped life
does not apply to the asset under subsection (4) or (5) at
the time mentioned in that paragraph; or
(iii) paragraph 40-95(2)(a) applies to you and the capped life
that applies to the asset under subsection (4) or (5) at the
time mentioned in that paragraph is longer than the
capped life that applies to the asset at its start time; or
(b) if paragraph (a) does not apply—the time mentioned in
paragraph 40-95(2)(a).

Liability rules of general application Chapter 2

Section 40-103
(a) starts to apply to a vessel (whether or not that item has
previously applied to the vessel); or
(b) ceases to apply to a vessel (whether or not that item
subsequently applies to the vessel);
at that time the effective life of the vessel changes accordingly.
(2) If subsection (1) applies and the decline in value of the vessel is
worked out using the *prime cost method, the remaining effective
life of the vessel just after that time is:
Unadjusted remaining effective life 

Alternative effective life
Unadjusted effective life

where:
alternative effective life is:
(a) if that item starts to apply to the vessel at that time—what
would have been the *effective life of the vessel just before
that time if that item had applied to the vessel; or
(b) if that item ceases to apply to the vessel at that time—what
would have been the effective life of the vessel just before
that time if that item had not applied to the vessel.
unadjusted effective life is what was the *effective life of the
vessel just before that time.
unadjusted remaining effective life is what was the *remaining
effective life of the vessel just before that time.
Example: Assume that item 10 of the table in subsection 40-102(4) ceases to
apply to a vessel after having applied to the vessel for 7 years, and
again starts to apply after another 4 years. Assume further that the
effective life of a vessel of that kind has been determined under
section 40-100 to be 20 years.
The remaining effective life of the vessel just before that item ceases
to apply to the vessel is 3 years. Its alternative effective life is 20
years, and its unadjusted effective life is 10 years. Its remaining
effective life just after that time is therefore 6 years.

Section 40-105
The remaining effective life of the vessel just before that item again
starts to apply to the vessel is 2 years. Its alternative effective life is 10
years, and its unadjusted effective life is 20 years. Its remaining
effective life just after that time is therefore 1 year.

40-105 Self-assessing effective life
(1) You work out the effective life of a *depreciating asset yourself in
accordance with this section.
(1A) Firstly, estimate the period (in years, including fractions of years)
the asset can be used by any entity for one or more of the following
purposes:
(a) a *taxable purpose;
(b) the purpose of producing *exempt income or *non-assessable
non-exempt income;
(c) the purpose of conducting *R&D activities, assuming that
this is reasonably likely.
(1B) Secondly, if relevant for the asset:
(a) have regard to the wear and tear you reasonably expect from
your expected circumstances of use; and
(b) assume that the asset will be maintained in reasonably good
order and condition.
(2) If, in working out that period, you decide that the asset would be
likely to be:
(a) scrapped; or
(b) sold for no more than scrap value or abandoned;
before the end of that period, its effective life ends at the earlier
time. However, when making your decision, disregard reasons
attributable to the technical risk in conducting *R&D activities if it
is reasonably likely that the asset will be used for such activities.
(3) You work out the period mentioned in subsection (1A) or (2)
beginning at the *start time of the *depreciating asset.

Section 40-110
Exception: intangibles
(4) This section does not apply to the following intangible
*depreciating assets:
(a) assets to which an item in the table in subsection 40-95(7)
applies;
(b) *mining, quarrying or prospecting rights;
(c) *mining, quarrying or prospecting information.

40-110 Recalculating effective life
(1) You may choose to recalculate the *effective life of a *depreciating
asset from a later income year if the effective life you have been
using is no longer accurate because of changed circumstances
relating to the nature of the use of the asset.
Example: Some examples of changes in circumstances that may result in your
recalculating the effective life of a depreciating asset are:
•
your use of the asset turns out to be more or less rigorous than
you expected (or was anticipated by the Commissioner’s
determination);
•
there is a downturn in demand for the goods or services the asset
is used to produce that will result in the asset being scrapped;
•
legislation prevents the asset’s continued use;
•
changes in technology make the asset redundant;
•
there is an unexpected demand, or lack of success, for a film.

(2) You must recalculate a *depreciating asset’s *effective life from a
later income year if:
(a) you:
(i) self-assessed its effective life; or
(ii) are using an effective life worked out under
section 40-100 (about the Commissioner’s
determination), or 40-102 (about the capped life of
certain depreciating assets), and the *prime cost method;
or
(iii) are using an effective life because of
subsection 40-95(4), (4B), (4C), (5), (5B) or (5C); and
*
(b) its cost is increased in that year by at least 10%.

Section 40-110
Note 1:

You may conclude that the effective life is the same.

Note 2:

For the elements of the cost of a depreciating asset, see
Subdivision 40-C.

Example 1: Paul purchases a photocopier and self-assesses its effective life at 6
years. In a later year he incurs expenditure to increase the quality of
the reproductions it makes. He recalculates its effective life, but
concludes that it remains the same.
Example 2: Fiona also purchases a photocopier and self-assesses its effective life
at 6 years. In a later year she incurs expenditure to incorporate a more
robust paper handling system. She recalculates its effective life, and
concludes that it is increased to 7 years.

(3) You must recalculate a *depreciating asset’s *effective life for the
income year in which you started to *hold it if:
(a) you are using an effective life because of
subsection 40-95(4), (4B), (4C), (5), (5B) or (5C); and
(b) the asset’s *cost is increased after you started to hold it in that
year by at least 10%.
(3A) Subsections (1), (2) and (3) do not apply to a *depreciating asset
that is a *mining, quarrying or prospecting right or *mining,
quarrying or prospecting information.
(3B) You may choose to recalculate the *effective life of a *mining,
quarrying or prospecting right, or *mining, quarrying or
prospecting information, from a later income year if the effective
life you have been using is no longer accurate:
(a) because of changed circumstances relating to an existing or
proposed mine, petroleum field or quarry to which that right
or information relates; or
(b) because that right or information now relates to an existing or
proposed mine, petroleum field or quarry; or
(c) because that right or information no longer relates to an
existing or proposed mine, petroleum field or quarry.
(4) A recalculation under this section must be done using:
(a) if paragraph (b) does not apply—section 40-105 (about
self-assessing effective life); or

Section 40-115
(b) if the *depreciating asset is a *mining, quarrying or
prospecting right or *mining, quarrying or prospecting
information:
(i) subsections 40-95(10) and (11) (if the right or
information relates to an existing or proposed mine,
petroleum field or quarry); or
(ii) subsection 40-95(12) (if the right or information no
longer relates to an existing or proposed mine,
petroleum field or quarry).
Exception: intangibles
(5) This section does not apply to an intangible *depreciating asset to
which an item in the table in subsection 40-95(7) applies.

40-115 Splitting a depreciating asset
(1) If a *depreciating asset you *hold is split into 2 or more assets, this
Division applies as if you had stopped holding the original asset
and started holding the assets into which it is split.
Note 1:

For the cost of the split assets, see section 40-205.

Note 2:

A balancing adjustment event does not occur just because you split a
depreciating asset: see section 40-295.

(2) If you stop *holding part of a *depreciating asset, this Division
applies as if, just before you stopped holding that part, you had
split the original asset into the part you stopped holding and the
rest of the original asset. (The rest of the original asset is then taken
to be a different asset from the original asset.)
Example: Bronwyn sells Tim a part interest in a depreciating asset she owns.
They become joint holders under section 40-35. She is taken to have
split the underlying asset into the interest she retains and the interest
Tim buys. She now holds an interest (a new depreciating asset) in the
underlying asset and is taken to have stopped holding the interest sold.

(3) If you grant or assign an interest in an item of *intellectual
property, subsection (2) applies to you as if you had stopped
*holding part of the item.

40-120 Replacement spectrum licences
(1) If:
(a) some (but not all) of a *spectrum licence you *hold is
assigned or resumed; and
(b) your original licence is replaced by one or more other
spectrum licences (possibly including a modified version of
your original licence); and
(c) the replacement licences together cover exactly the same
rights as were covered by your original licence just after the
assignment or resumption;
this Division applies as if your original licence (as it existed just
after the assignment or resumption) had been split into the
replacement licences.
Example: MGP Communications Ltd buys a spectrum licence on 1 July 2003 for
$5 million. The licence specifies areas A, B, C and D. The company
assigns the spectrum relating to area C. Area C represents 20% of the
market value of the overall licence. $1m of the adjustable value is
allocated to it and $4m is allocated to the remaining licence.
The Australian Communications and Media Authority adjusts the
licence to specify only areas A and B, and issues a new licence
specifying area D.
Area D represents 25% of the market value of the spectrum remaining
in the licence. The adjustable value of the new licence is therefore
$1m and the adjustable value of the original (modified) licence is
$3m.

(2) If a *spectrum licence you *hold is replaced by 2 or more spectrum
licences (possibly including a modified version of your original
licence) that together cover exactly the same rights as your original
licence, this Division applies as if the original licence had been
split into the replacement licences.

Section 40-125
(a) a *depreciating asset you *hold is a *mining, quarrying or
prospecting right (the old right) that relates to an area; and
(b) you begin to hold another depreciating asset (the partial new
right) that:
(i) is a mining, quarrying or prospecting right; and
(ii) relates to an area that is a part of the area that the old
right relates to; and
(c) the old right does not end when you begin to hold the partial
new right.
(2) This Division applies as if:
(a) when you begin to hold the partial new right, the old right is
split into:
(i) an asset that is the partial new right; and
(ii) an asset that is the old right; and
(b) the assets mentioned in subparagraphs (a)(i) and (ii) are both
continuations of the old right.
Note:

For the cost of the split assets, see section 40-205.

40-125 Merging depreciating assets
If a *depreciating asset or assets that you *hold is or are merged
into another depreciating asset, this Division applies as if you had
stopped holding the original asset or assets and started holding the
merged asset.
Note 1:

For the cost of the merged asset, see section 40-210.

Note 2:

A balancing adjustment event does not occur just because you merge
depreciating assets: see section 40-295.

40-130 Choices
(1) A choice you can make under this Division about a *depreciating
asset must be made:
(a) by the day you lodge your *income tax return for the income
year to which the choice relates; or
(b) within a further time allowed by the Commissioner.

(b) Division 16D (Certain arrangements relating to the use of
property) of Part III of that Act;
apply to your deductions under this Division for a *depreciating
asset you *hold as if you were the owner of the asset instead of any
other person.

40-140 Getting tax information from associates
(1) If you acquire a *depreciating asset from an *associate of yours
where the associate has deducted or can deduct an amount for the
asset under this Division, you may give the associate a written
notice requiring the associate to tell you:
(a) the method the associate was using to work out the decline in
value of the asset; and
(b) the *effective life the associate was using; and
(c) if section 40-102 applied to the asset at any time:
(i) the effective life that the associate would have used if
section 40-102 had not applied to the asset; and
(ii) the relevant time that applied to the associate under
subsection 40-102(3).
(2) The notice must:

(3) The first element of *cost includes an amount you paid or are taken
to have paid in relation to starting to *hold the *depreciating asset if
that amount is directly connected with holding the asset.
(4) The first element of *cost of a *depreciating asset does not include
an amount that forms part of the second element of cost of another
depreciating asset.
Note:

The first element of cost may be reduced under section 40-1130 to
account for exploration benefits received under farm-in farm-out
arrangements.

40-185 Amount you are taken to have paid to hold a depreciating
asset or to receive a benefit
(1) This Division applies to you as if you had paid, to *hold a
*depreciating asset or for an economic benefit for such an asset, the
greater of these amounts:
(a) the sum of the amounts that would have been included in
your assessable income because you started to hold the asset
or received the benefit, or because you gave something to
start holding the asset or receive the benefit, if you ignored
the value of anything you gave that reduced the amount
actually included; or
(b) the sum of the applicable amounts set out in this table in
relation to holding the asset or receiving the benefit.
Example 1: Gold Medals Ltd manufactures some medals for a local sporting
association’s annual meeting in return for a die cut stamping machine.
The medals have a market value of $20,000. The machine has an
arm’s length value of $100,000 but Gold Medals has to contribute
$75,000 towards acquiring it from the association. Gold Medals will
have to include:

the amount it paid ($75,000) plus the market value of the
non-cash benefits it provided ($20,000), which comes to
$95,000; and
the amount that was assessable income from receiving the
machine ($25,000) plus the amount by which that assessable
income was reduced because of the payment Gold Medals made
($75,000), which comes to $100,000.

So, in this case, the first element of the machine’s cost to Gold Medals
is $100,000.
Example 2: Laura travels overseas to purchase a purpose-built vehicle for use in
her trade. The purchase of the vehicle is the sole reason for the trip.
Laura incurs expenses for airfares and accommodation. These
expenses are included in the cost of the vehicle because they are “in
relation to starting to hold” the vehicle.

benefit
Item

In this case:

The amount is:

1

You pay an amount

The amount

2

You incur or increase a liability to
pay an amount

The amount of the liability or increase
when you incurred or increased it

3

All or part of a liability to pay an
amount owed to you by another
entity is terminated

The amount of the liability or part when
it is terminated

4

You provide a *non-cash benefit

The *market value of the non-cash
benefit when it is provided

5

You incur or increase a liability to

Note 2:

Section 230-505 provides special rules for working out the amount of
consideration for an asset if the asset is a Division 230 financial
arrangement or a Division 230 financial arrangement is involved in
that consideration.

(2) In applying the table in subsection (1) to a liability of yours to pay
an amount or provide a *non-cash benefit, don’t count any part of
the liability you have already satisfied.

40-190 Second element of cost
(1) The second element is worked out after you start to *hold the
*depreciating asset.
(2) The second element is:
(a) the amount you are taken to have paid under section 40-185
for each economic benefit that has contributed to bringing the
asset to its present condition and location from time to time
since you started to *hold the asset; and
(b) expenditure you incur that is reasonably attributable to a
*balancing adjustment event occurring for the asset.
Example 1: Andrew adds a new tray and canopy to his ute. The materials and
labour that go into the addition are economic benefits that Andrew
received and that contribute to the ute’s present condition.
The payments he makes for those economic benefits are included in
the second element of the ute’s cost.
Example 2: Leonie needed to replace one of her old depreciating assets that was
fixed to her land with a new, more efficient one. Leonie paid a
contractor a fee to demolish and remove the old asset. This resulted in
a balancing adjustment event occurring for the old asset, and the fee
forms part of the second element of the cost of the old asset that was
demolished.
Note:

The second element of the cost may be modified by a later provision
in this Subdivision.

(2A) Paragraph (2)(b) does not apply to a *balancing adjustment event
referred to in item 6 or 11 of the table in subsection 40-300(2).

Second element of the cost of a depreciating asset
Item

In this case:

The second element of cost is:

1

You received the benefit under an
*arrangement and:
(a) there is at least one other party to
the arrangement with whom you
did not deal at *arm’s length; and
(b) apart from this item, the second
element of cost for the benefit
would exceed its *market value

The market value of the benefit
when you received it

2

You received the benefit under an
*arrangement that was private or
domestic in nature to you

The *market value of the benefit
when you received it

40-195 Apportionment of cost
If you pay an amount for 2 or more things that include at least one
*depreciating asset, or that include a contribution to bringing a
depreciating asset to its present condition and location, you take
into account as part of its *cost only that part of what you paid that
is reasonably attributable to the asset.
Example: Ian buys 3 assets (one depreciating asset and 2 other assets) under the
one transaction. He pays $30,000 for the 3 assets. $25,000 of that
amount is reasonably attributable to the depreciating asset.
The first element of the depreciating asset’s cost is $25,000.

40-200 Exclusion from cost
The *cost of a *depreciating asset that is not *plant does not include
any amount that was incurred:
(a) before 1 July 2001; or
(b) under a contract entered into before that day.

40-205 Cost of a split depreciating asset
If you split a *depreciating asset into separate assets as mentioned
in section 40-115, the first element of the cost of each of the
separate assets is a reasonable proportion of the sum of these
amounts:
(a) the *adjustable value of the original asset just before it was
split; and
(b) the amount you are taken to have paid under section 40-185
for any economic benefit involved in splitting the original
asset.
Example: Barry owns a spectrum licence that covers 3 areas: Area A, area B and
area C. The licence has an adjustable value of $160,000. He sells area
A to Chris, and his costs of splitting are $10,000. Barry is taken to
have split the licence into 2 assets.
On the basis of their relative market values, Barry apportions
$170,000 to area A (that he disposed of) and to the licence he still
holds for areas B and C.

40-210 Cost of merged depreciating assets
If a *depreciating asset or assets that you *hold is or are merged
into another depreciating asset as mentioned in section 40-125, the
first element of the cost of the merged asset is a reasonable
proportion of the sum of:
(a) the *adjustable value or adjustable values of the original asset
or assets just before the merger; and
(b) the amount you are taken to have paid under section 40-185
for any economic benefit involved in merging the original
asset or assets.

40-215 Adjustment: double deduction
Each element of the *cost of a *depreciating asset is reduced by any
portion of that element of cost that you have deducted or can
deduct, or that has been or will be taken into account in working
out an amount you can deduct, other than under this Division,
Division 41 or Division 328.

If:
(a) because of subsection 40-30(6), this Division applies to a
*mining, quarrying or prospecting right (the new right) as if
it were a continuation of another mining, quarrying or
prospecting right you *held; and
(b) the new right satisfies the condition in subparagraph (b)(ii) of

which you have a *cost under item 3, 4 or 14 of the table in
subsection 40-180(2). Instead, the asset’s *opening adjustable value
for the income year (the later year) after the one in which the
*balancing adjustment event occurred is that cost plus any amounts
included in the second element of that cost after the event occurred
and before the start of the later year.
Note:

Those items deal with a case where a balancing adjustment event
happens even though you still hold the asset in question.

(5) Despite subsection (1), an amount included in your assessable
income under that subsection is included for the second income
year after the income year in which the *balancing adjustment
event occurs if:

(a) a *balancing adjustment event happens in an income year (the
event year) for an asset you *held and for which:
(i) you can deduct, for an income year, an amount under
section 40-25, as that section applies apart from
Division 355 and former section 73BC of the Income

Assessment Act 1936 (see section 40-292 of the Income Tax
(Transitional Provisions) Act 1997).

Note 2:

To the extent that any amount is included in your assessable income

Section 40-340
Note 2:

This Act also applies as if there were roll-over relief under this
subsection in the circumstances set out in section 620-30 (which is
about a body incorporated under one law ceasing to exist and
disposing of its assets to a company incorporated under another law
that has not significantly different ownership).

(2) In applying an item in the table in subsection (1), disregard the
following so far as they relate to the *depreciating asset you
disposed of:
(a) an exemption in Division 118 (which contains the general
exemptions from CGT); and
(b) subsection 122-25(3) (which excludes certain assets from
some kinds of CGT roll-over); and
(c) subsection 124-870(5) (which excludes certain assets from
roll-over relief under Subdivision 124-N).
Choosing roll-over relief
(3) There is also roll-over relief if:
(a) there is a *balancing adjustment event for a *depreciating
asset because of subsection 40-295(2) (about a change in the
holding of, or in interests in, the asset); and
(b) the entity or entities that had an interest in the asset before
the change (also the transferor) and the entity or entities that
have an interest in the asset after the change (also the
transferee) jointly choose the roll-over relief.
Example: The change could be a variation in the constitution of a partnership or
in the interests of the partners.
Note 1:

Section 40-345 sets out what the relief is.

Note 2:

Subdivision 328-D sets out what the relief is for small business
entities that calculate deductions for their depreciating assets under

Section 40-345
40-345 What the roll-over relief is
(1) Section 40-285 does not apply to the *balancing adjustment event
for the transferor.
(2) The transferee can deduct the decline in value of the *depreciating
asset using the same method and *effective life (or *remaining
effective life if that method is the *prime cost method) that the
transferor was using.

40-350 Additional consequences
(1) For the purposes of Division 45:
(a) if the transferor, or a partnership of which the transferor was
a member, leased the *depreciating asset to another entity for
most of the time that the transferor or partnership *held the
asset, the transferee is taken also to have done so; and
(b) if the transferor, or a partnership of which the transferor was
a member, leased the asset to another entity for a period on or
after 22 February 1999, the transferee is taken also to have
done so; and
(c) if the main *business of the transferor, or a partnership of
which the transferor was a member, was to lease assets, the
main business of the transferee is taken also to have been to
lease assets.
(2) However, subsection (1) does not apply to roll-over relief under
subsection 40-340(3) if the sum of the amounts specified in
paragraph 45-5(1)(e) or 45-10(1)(f), or subsection 45-5(4) or
45-10(4), is at least equal to the *market value of the *plant or

40-370 Balancing adjustments where there has been use of different
car expense methods
(1) An amount is included in your assessable income or you can
deduct an amount under this section instead of section 40-285 if:
(a) a *balancing adjustment event occurs for a *car you *held;
and
(b) you have deducted or can deduct an amount for the decline in
value of the car for an income year under this Division; and
(c) you chose the “cents per kilometre” method in
Subdivision 28-C for deducting your car expenses for the car
for one or more other income years.
Note 1:

This means if you have only used the “log book” method since you
began using the car, you calculate the assessable amount or deductible
amount under section 40-285.

Note 2:

Also, if you have only used the “cents per kilometre” method since
you began using the car, no amount is assessable or deductible under
this section or section 40-285.

(2) Work out the amount you include in your assessable income or the
amount you can deduct in this way:
Method statement
Step 1.

Subtract the *car’s *adjustable value just before the
*balancing adjustment event occurred from the car’s
*termination value.

Step 2.

Reduce the step 1 amount by the part of the *car’s decline
in value that is attributable to your using the car, or
having it *installed ready for use, for purposes other than
*taxable purposes. You do this by applying the formula in
subsection 40-290(2).

Step 3.

Multiply the step 2 amount by the total number of days
for which you deducted the decline in value of the *car
under this Division.

Step 4.

Divide the step 3 amount by the total number of days you
*held the *car.

Step 5.

The step 4 amount is a deduction if it is negative or it is
included in your assessable income if it is positive.

(3) In working out the *adjustable value for the income years for which
you chose the “cents per kilometre method”, assume the decline in
value was calculated under this Division on the same basis as those
income years when that method did not apply.
(4) In working out the reduction in step 2 for the income years for
which you chose the “cents per kilometre method”, assume that:
(a) you had not chosen that method for the *car; and
(b) Division 28 (about car expenses) had not applied to the car;
and

(1) You may choose to allocate a *low cost asset you *hold to a
low-value pool for the income year in which you start to use it, or
have it *installed ready for use, for a *taxable purpose.
(2) A low-cost asset is a *depreciating asset (except a *horticultural
plant) whose *cost as at the end of the income year in which you
start to use it, or have it *installed ready for use, for a *taxable
purpose is less than $1,000.
(3) You may also choose to allocate a *low-value asset to a low-value
pool.
(4) You cannot allocate a *depreciating asset to a low-value pool if:
(a) its *cost does not exceed $300; and
(b) you use the asset predominantly for the *purpose of
producing assessable income that is not income from
carrying on a *business; and
(c) the asset is not part of a set of assets that you started to hold
in that income year where the total cost of the set of assets
exceeds $300; and
(d) the total cost of the asset and any other identical, or

*diminishing value method; and
(b) that has an *opening adjustable value for the current year of
less than $1,000 (worked out using the diminishing value
method); and
(c) that is not a *low-cost asset.
(6) A *depreciating asset:
(a) to which Division 58 (about assets previously owned by an

(b) for which you used the *diminishing value method; and
(c) whose *adjustable value as at the end of the income year
before the *current year is less than $1,000;
is also a low-value asset.
Exception: small business entities
(7) You cannot allocate a *depreciating asset to a low-value pool if you
deduct amounts for it under Subdivision 328-D (about capital
allowances for small business entities).
Exception: medium sized businesses
(7A) You cannot allocate a *depreciating asset to a low-value pool if the
decline in value of the asset for any income year is determined by

Section 40-430
40-430 Rules for assets in low-value pools
(1) Once you have made a choice to allocate a *low-cost asset to a
low-value pool for an income year, you must allocate all low-cost
assets you start to *hold in that income year or a later one to the
pool.
Note 1:

This rule does not apply to low-value assets.

Note 2:

If you are a small business entity for the income year and you
calculate your deductions for your depreciating assets under
Subdivision 328-D, you must deduct amounts for your depreciating
assets under that Subdivision unless deductions for particular assets
are specifically excluded by that Subdivision.

(2) Once you allocate any *depreciating asset to a low-value pool, it
must remain in the pool.

40-435 Private or exempt use of assets
(1) When you allocate a *depreciating asset to a low-value pool, you
must make a reasonable estimate of the percentage (the taxable use
percentage) of your use of the asset (including any past use) that
will be for a *taxable purpose over:
(a) for a *low-cost asset—its *effective life; or
(b) for a *low-value asset—any period of its effective life that is
yet to elapse at the start of the income year for which you
allocate it to the pool.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), disregard a *taxable purpose
that is the *purpose of producing assessable income:
(a) from the use of *residential premises to provide residential
accommodation; but
(b) not in the course of carrying on a *business;
if, apart from subsections 40-25(5) and 40-27(6), section 40-27
would reduce your deductions under subsection 40-25(1) for the
asset.

Section 40-440
40-440 How you work out the decline in value of assets in low-value
pools
(1) You work out the decline in value of *depreciating assets in a
low-value pool for an income year in this way:
Step 1.

Work out the amount obtained by taking 183/4% of the
taxable use percentage of the *cost of each *low-cost
asset you allocated to the pool for that year. Add those
amounts.

Step 2.

Add to the step 1 amount 183/4% of the taxable use
percentage of any amounts included in the second
element of the *cost for that year of:
(a)

assets allocated to the pool for an earlier income
year; and

(b)

*low-value
*current

Step 3.

Step 4.

assets allocated to the pool for the
year.

Add to the step 2 amount 371/2% of the sum of:
(a)

the *closing pool balance for the previous income
year; and

(b)

the taxable use percentage of the *opening
adjustable values of *low-value assets, at the start
of the income year, that you allocated to the pool
for that year.

The result is the decline in value of the *depreciating
assets in the pool.

(2) The closing pool balance of a low-value pool for an income year is
the sum of:

you allocated to the pool for that year; and
(c) the taxable use percentage of the *opening adjustable values
of any *low-value assets you allocated to the pool for that
year as at the start of that year; and
(d) the taxable use percentage of any amounts included in the
second element of the cost for the income year of:
(i) assets allocated to the pool for an earlier income year;
and
(ii) low-value assets allocated to the pool for the *current
year;
less the decline in value of the *depreciating assets in the pool
worked out under subsection (1).
Note:

The closing pool balance may be reduced under section 40-445 if a
balancing adjustment event happens.

40-445 Balancing adjustment events
(1) If a *balancing adjustment event happens to a *depreciating asset in
a low-value pool in an income year, the *closing pool balance for
that year is reduced (but not below zero) by the taxable use
percentage of the asset’s *termination value.
(2) If the sum of the *termination values, or the part of it, applicable
under subsection (1) exceeds the *closing pool balance of the pool
for that year, the excess is included in your assessable income.

40-450 Software development pools
(1) You may choose to allocate amounts of expenditure you incur on
*in-house software in an income year to a software development
pool if it is expenditure on developing, or having another entity
develop, computer software.

Note:

You cannot allocate expenditure on in-house software to a software
development pool if it is expenditure on acquiring computer software
or a right to use computer software.

(2) Once you choose to create a software development pool for an
income year, any amounts of the kind referred to in subsection (1)
you incur after the pool is created (whether in that income year or a
later one) must be allocated to a software development pool.
(3) However, an amount of expenditure on *in-house software can
only be allocated to a software development pool if you intend to
use the software solely for a *taxable purpose.
(4) You must create a separate software development pool for each
income year for which you incur amounts of the kind referred to in
subsection (1).

pool value is:
(a) for the first income year that a *project amount is allocated to
the pool—the sum of the project amounts allocated to the
pool for that year; or
(b) for a later income year—the sum of the pool’s *closing pool

Consequences for transferors
40-1105 Treatment of certain exploration benefits received under
farm-in farm-out arrangements
If, under a *farm-in farm-out arrangement, you receive an
*exploration benefit in relation to the transfer of part of your
interest in a *mining, quarrying or prospecting right, the
*termination value of the part of the interest is reduced by the
*market value of the exploration benefit.

arrangements
Despite section 40-205, if:
(a) under a *farm-in farm-out arrangement, you provide a part of
your interest in a *mining, quarrying or prospecting right; and
(b) because of subsection 40-115(2), this Division applies as if
you had split your interest into the part you stopped *holding
and the rest of your interest;
then:
(c) the first element of the *cost of the asset that consists of the
part you stopped holding is a reasonable proportion of the
amount you are taken to have paid under section 40-185 for
any economic benefit involved in splitting your interest; and

interest you provide is reduced (including reduced to nil);
and
(c) the exploration benefit consists of another party to the
arrangement funding on your behalf, or undertaking to fund
on your behalf, expenditure that you incur in relation to
exploration or prospecting;
your entitlement (if any) to a deduction under a provision of this
Act in relation to that expenditure is reduced to the same extent as
the extent to which the expenditure is reasonably attributable to the
exploration benefit.

Deductions for capital works Division 43

Section 43-15
(c) you use *your area in the income year in the way set out in
Table 43-140 (Current year use).
Note 1:

The deduction is limited to capital works to which this Division
applies, see section 43-20.

Note 2:

Amongst other things, the definition of your area ensures that only
owners and certain lessees of capital works, and certain holders of
quasi-ownership rights over land on which capital works are
constructed, can deduct an amount under this Division.

43-15 Amount you can deduct
(1) The amount you can deduct is a portion of *your construction
expenditure. However, it cannot exceed the amount of *undeducted
construction expenditure for *your area.
Note:

The limit in this subsection has 2 effects:
•
It ensures that not more than 100% of your construction
expenditure can be deducted.
•
It imposes a time limit on the period over which your
construction expenditure can be deducted. For capital works
begun before 27 February 1992, that period will be 25 years if
the rate of deduction is 4% or 40 years if the rate is 2.5%. For
other capital works, the period will be 25 years or 40 years or
some period between 25 and 40 years depending on their use.

(2) Your deduction is calculated under section 43-210 or 43-215.

43-20 Capital works to which this Division applies
Buildings
(1) This Division applies to capital works being a building, or an
extension, alteration or improvement to a building:
(a) begun in Australia after 21 August 1979; or

(2) The deduction is allowable in the income year in which the
destruction occurs, and is calculated under section 43-250.
Note:

The effect of this provision is to allow you to deduct an amount in the
income year in which the capital works are destroyed for all of your
construction expenditure that has not yet been deducted. However,
you must reduce the deduction by any insurance and salvage receipts.

43-45 Certain anti-avoidance provisions
These anti-avoidance provisions:
(a) section 51AD (Deductions not allowable in respect of
property under certain leveraged arrangements) of the
Income Tax Assessment Act 1936;
(b) Division 16D (Certain arrangements relating to the use of
property) of Part III of that Act;

Links
(1) No part of a *pool of construction expenditure can be a deduction,
or taken into account in working out the amount of a deduction,
under a provision of this Act other than this Division.
(2) No part of an amount incurred by an entity in acquiring capital
works for which there is a *pool of construction expenditure can be
a deduction, or taken into account in working out the amount of a
deduction, under a provision of this Act other than this Division.
(3) You will be taken not to be the owner of any part of capital works
that are the subject of a lease to which you have chosen to apply
section 104-115 (CGT event F2). The lessee or sublessee will be
taken to be the owner of that part.
Note 1:

Choosing to apply section 104-115 results in the lease being treated
for CGT purposes more like an outright disposal.

held by the entity that incurred the expenditure;
• for capital works begun before 1 July 1997, the area of the
capital works that was to be used in a particular manner.
A pool of construction expenditure is that part of an amount of
construction expenditure that is attributable to a particular
construction expenditure area.

Section 43-75
(a) the capital works would have had a construction expenditure
area but for the fact that the other entity did not incur capital
expenditure in constructing the capital works; and
(b) the other entity is not an *associate of the entity; and
(c) the other entity constructed the capital works on land that it
owned or leased in the course of a business that included the
construction and sale of capital works of that kind.
Note:

Subsection (3) makes capital works purchased from a speculative
builder eligible for deduction in the hands of the first and subsequent
purchasers.

(4) The construction of the capital works must be complete before the
*construction expenditure area is determined.
(5) Only one *construction expenditure area is created each time an
entity constructs capital works.
Example: An entity undertakes the construction of a building. During the course
of construction, the entity makes 3 progress payments to the builder.
There is still only one construction expenditure area.

(6) A separate *construction expenditure area will be created each time
an entity undertakes the construction of capital works.
Example: In the diagram below, area 1 relates to the original construction of a
building which gives rise to one construction expenditure area. Area 2
is a subsequent extension of the same building which gives rise to
another, while area 3 is a later renovation of the entire building which
gives rise to another.

those works must be put, the rate of deduction and the calculation
mechanism used. However, the time when capital works begin does
not limit what qualifies as construction expenditure.

43-85 Pools of construction expenditure
(1) A pool of construction expenditure is so much of the *construction
expenditure incurred by an entity on capital works as is attributable
to the *construction expenditure area.

43-130 Identifying your area on acquisition or disposal
There will be a separate *your area at each time in an income year
when you:
(a) acquire an additional part of a *construction expenditure area;
or
(b) dispose of some but not all of a construction expenditure
area.
Example: You own half of a building (part A) throughout the income year, and
you acquire the other half (part B) on 1 January. This section ensures
that part A is your area for the entire year and that part B is your area
for the second 6 months of the year.
Note:

This ensures that the same area is not counted twice in calculating
your deduction. You will have to make separate deduction
calculations if you have identified more than one area as your area of
the capital works.

owner of certain capital works), you can still count an apartment,
unit or flat in relation to which CGT event F2 has happened in
working out whether you own or lease at least 10 apartments, units
or flats in an *apartment building if you own or lease at least one

Section 43-205
43-205 Explanatory material
Capital works begun before 27 February 1992
The calculation for these works is based on *your construction
expenditure and the applicable rate of deduction. There can be only
one rate of deduction that applies to *your area. However,
reductions of deductions may apply.
You must reduce your deduction for any period in the income year
that you did not own *your area and use it in the way described in
Table 43-140 (Current year use). Because there are 2 use tests in
Table 43-140 for *hotel buildings and *apartment buildings (a
general income producing test and a more specific hotel and
short-term traveller accommodation use test), there are 2 reduction
steps.
The first step reduces your deduction if part of *your area was not
used as a *hotel building or *apartment building. The second step
reduces the deduction to the extent that your area is used only
partly for the *purpose of producing assessable income. This
occurs, for example, if you *derive both assessable and exempt
income, or if part of your area is not used to produce assessable
income for all or part of the period it was used as a hotel building
or apartment building.
Capital works begun after 26 February 1992
The calculation for these works is based on a portion of *your
construction expenditure and the applicable rate of deduction.
There can be 2 rates of deduction for your area depending on the
way you use it.
If 2 rates apply, there will be a separate calculation for the part of
*your area used in the way described in Table 43-140 and for the
part of *your area used in the way described in Table 43-145 (Use
in the 4% manner). A gross deduction and subsequent reduction is
calculated for each.

The reduction is the same as the second reduction for capital works
begun before 27 February 1992.

Operative provisions
43-210 Deduction for capital works begun after 26 February 1992
Step 1 Calculate the amount worked out using the formula:
Portion of your CE  Days used  0.04
365

where:
portion of your CE is the portion of *your construction expenditure
that is attributable to the part of *your area that you used in the *4%
manner.
days used is the number of days in the income year that:
(a) you owned or were the lessee of that part of *your area and
used it in the *4% manner; or
(b) you were the holder of that part of *your area under a
*quasi-ownership right over land granted by an *exempt
Australian government agency or an *exempt foreign
government agency, and used that part of your area in the 4%
manner.
Step 2 Reduce the Step 1 amount by the extent to which the part
referred to in Step 1 was used only partly for the *purpose of
producing assessable income.
Note:

This Step applies if:
•
part of your income from the part referred to in Step 1 is exempt
income; or
•
part of the part referred to in Step 1 was not used for the purpose
of producing assessable income or was not available for that use;
or
•
the part of the part referred to in Step 1 was not used for such a
purpose during a part of the days used period.

(b) you were the holder of that part of *your area under a
*quasi-ownership right over land granted by an *exempt
Australian government agency or an *exempt foreign
government agency, and used that part of your area in that
manner.
Step 4 Reduce the Step 3 amount by the extent to which the part
referred to in Step 3:
(a) for a *hotel building or *apartment building—was used only
partly for the *purpose of producing assessable income; or
(b) for any other capital works—was used only partly for the
purpose of *producing assessable income or conducting
*R&D activities.
Note:

This Step applies if:

income; or
•
part of the part referred to in Step 3 was not used for the purpose
of producing assessable income (or R&D activities) or was not
available for that use; or
•

43-230 Calculating undeducted construction expenditure—common
step
(1) Identify the date when the capital works began.
Note 1:

The date determines whether your calculation is to be made under
section 43-235 (for post-26/2/92 expenditure) or 43-240 (for
pre-27/2/92 expenditure).

Note 2:

Section 43-80 explains when capital works begin.

(2) If you are calculating a deduction under Subdivision 43-F, identify
the period (use period) that:
(a) started when *your area, or a part of it, was first used by any
entity for any purpose after completion of the relevant
construction; and
(b) ended at the end of the preceding income year or, if you
acquired your area during the income year, at the end of the
day before the time of the acquisition.
(3) If you are calculating a deduction under Subdivision 43-H, identify
the period (use period) that started at the time described in
paragraph (2)(a) and ended at the time of the destruction.

43-235 Post-26 February 1992 undeducted construction expenditure
Step 1 Calculate for each day in the use period the amount worked
out using the formula:
Portion of your CE  0.04

where:
portion of your CE is the portion of *your construction expenditure
that is attributable to the part of *your area that you used in the *4%

area; and
(b) on a day (the cessation day) in the income year or a prior
income year, the *active build to rent development of the
active build to rent development area *ceases to be an active
build to rent development.
(2) Section 43-235 applies to the part as if for each day in the use
period:
(a) before the cessation day; and
(b) that the part was an *active build to rent development;
you did not use the part in the *4% manner.

Build to rent misuse amounts
44-20 Build to rent misuse amounts
(1) You have a build to rent misuse amount for an income year, equal
to the amount worked under subsection (2), if the amount worked
out under that subsection is greater than nil.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the amount is the sum of:
(a) the amount that is the sum of your *build to rent capital
works deduction amounts, worked out under section 44-25,
for each *build to rent development to which subsection (3)
of this section applies for the income year (if any); and
(b) the amount that is 10 times the sum of your *build to rent
withholding amounts, worked out under section 44-30, for
each build to rent development to which subsection (3) of
this section applies for the income year (if any).
(3) For the purposes of paragraphs (2)(a) and (b), this subsection
applies to a *build to rent development for an income year if:
(a) the build to rent development *ceases to be an *active build to
rent development during the income year; and
(b) you owned the *dwellings of the build to rent development
immediately before that cessation.

44-25 Your build to rent capital works deduction amount

Step 2.

For each of those years:
(a)

identify each *construction expenditure area of
capital works that are or include the *active build
to rent development area of the *build to rent
development at any time during the year; and

(b)

calculate the amount worked out by the following
formula for each construction expenditure area:
Portion of construction expenditure  Days used
365

where:
active build to rent part, of the *construction expenditure
area, is the part of the area that was the *active build to
rent development area, or part of the active build to rent
development area at any time during the year.
days used is the number of days in the income year that:
(a)

any entity owned or was the lessee of the *active
build to rent part and used it in the *4% build to
rent manner; or

(b)

any entity was the holder of the active build to rent
part under a *quasi ownership right over land
granted by an *exempt Australian government
agency or an *exempt foreign government agency,
and used it in the 4% build to rent manner.

portion of construction expenditure is the portion of
*construction expenditure that is attributable to the
*active build to rent part.

Section 44-25
Step 3.

Reduce the Step 2 amount for each *construction
expenditure area, for each year, by the extent to which
the *active build to rent part was used only partly for the
*purpose of producing assessable income in the year.
Note:

This step applies if:
(a) part of the income from the active build to rent part is
exempt income; or
(b) part of the active build to rent part was not used for
the purpose of producing assessable income or was not
available for that use; or
(c) the active build to rent part was not used for such a
purpose during a part of the days used period.

Step 4.

For each year, add up the amounts worked out under Step
3 for each *construction expenditure area.

Step 5.

Add up the Step 4 amounts for each year.

Step 6.

Multiply the Step 5 amount by:
(a)

if *you are a company (other than a company in the
capacity of a trustee)—the *corporate tax rate for
the income year in which the *build to rent
development *ceases to be an *active build to rent
development (the cessation year); or

(b)

in any other case—the maximum rate specified in
the table in Part I of Schedule 7 to the Income Tax
Rates Act 1986 for the cessation year.

Step 7.

Your build to rent capital works deduction amount is
the Step 6 amount multiplied by 1.08.

Note:

You can have more than one build to rent capital works deduction
amount because there can be more than one build to rent development
for which you have a build to rent capital works deduction amount.

Your build to rent withholding amount, for a *build to rent
development that *ceases to be an *active build to rent
development, is the amount worked out as follows:
Method statement
Step 1.

Identify each income year in which, at any time during
the year, the *build to rent development was an *active
build to rent development.

Step 2.

For each of those years, identify each *fund payment
made by the owner of the *active build to rent
development, or each part of such a fund payment, (if
any) that is referable to any of the following:
(a)

a payment of rental income under a lease of a
of the active build to rent development;

*dwelling

(b)
Note:

a *capital gain from a *CGT event in relation to a
dwelling of the active build to rent development.
For the purposes of this step, it does not matter whether
an amount must be withheld from a fund payment under
Part 2-5 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration
Act 1953.

Step 3.

For each year add up the amounts of payments, or parts
of payments, identified under Step 2.

Step 4.

Add up the Step 3 amounts for each year.

Step 5.

Your build to rent withholding amount is the Step 4
amount multiplied by 1.08.

Step 1.

Work out the payments under the Social Security Act
1991 that would have become due to you during the
bereavement lump sum period if:
(a)

your partner had not died; and

(b)

your partner had been under *pension age; and

(c)

immediately before your partner died, you and
your partner had been neither an illness separated
couple nor a respite care couple.

Step 2.

Work out how much of those payments would have been
exempt in those circumstances.

Step 3.

Work out the payments under the Social Security Act
1991 or Part III of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986
that would have become due to your partner during the
bereavement lump sum period if:
(a)

your partner had not died; and

(b)

immediately before your partner died, you and
your partner were neither an illness separated
couple nor a respite care couple;

even if the payments would not have been exempt.
Step 4.

result is the tax-free amount.

Example: You are receiving a disability support pension of $300 a fortnight and
a pharmaceutical allowance of $5 a fortnight. You are over pension
age. Your partner is receiving a jobseeker payment of $250 a fortnight

This Division sets out special rules that apply in calculating
deductions for the decline in value of depreciating assets and
balancing adjustments for assets previously owned by an exempt
entity if the assets:
•

continue to be owned by that entity after the entity becomes
taxable; or

•

are acquired from that entity, in connection with the
acquisition of a business, by a purchaser that is a taxable
entity.

There is a choice of 2 methods for each depreciating asset:
•

the notional written down value method; and

•

the undeducted pre-existing audited book value method.

income becomes to any extent assessable income.
(3) In an entity sale situation:
(a) the entity is a transition entity; and
(b) the time when the entity’s *ordinary income or *statutory
income becomes to that extent assessable is the transition
time; and
(c) the income year in which the *transition time occurs is the
transition year for the entity; and
(d) the *depreciating assets the *transition entity *held just before
the transition time are privatised assets.
Asset sale
(4) The second (an asset sale situation) is where:
(a) at a particular time on or after 1 July 2001, an entity (the

65-10 What this Division is about
This Division sets out the rules about carrying forward excess tax
offsets to later income years.
You can only carry forward certain tax offsets.
Before you can apply a tax offset to reduce the amount of income
tax that you will pay in a later year, you must apply it to reduce
certain amounts of net exempt income.
The same rules that prevent companies from utilising certain losses
of earlier income years prevent companies from applying tax
offsets that they have carried forward.

Section 65-35
(2) However, reduce the *tax offset by the amount worked out by
multiplying your *net exempt income by:
(a) if you are a base rate entity (within the meaning of the
Income Tax Rates Act 1986) for the income year—0.25; or
(b) otherwise—0.3;
if you have a taxable income for the income year.

65-35 How to apply carried forward tax offsets
(1) A *tax offset that you have carried forward decreases the amount of
income tax that you would otherwise have to pay under
section 4-10 in a later income year.
(2) You apply a *tax offset that is carried forward to a later year in
accordance with the priorities set out in Division 63 as if it were a
tax offset for that later year.
(3) Before you apply a *tax offset to reduce the amount of income tax
that you pay in a later income year in which you have a taxable
income, you must apply it to reduce to nil any *net exempt income
for:
(a) that later income year; or
(b) any income year after the year in which the tax offset arose
and before the later income year in which you had a taxable
income but did not apply the tax offset to reduce the amount
of income tax you had to pay.
Note:

Paragraph (b) would apply to cases such as where your taxable
income was below your tax-free threshold or where you had other tax
offsets that reduced your income tax to nil.

(3A) In reducing *net exempt income for an income year under
subsection (3):
(a) if you were a base rate entity (within the meaning of the
Income Tax Rates Act 1986) for the year—each 25 cents of
*tax offset reduces the net exempt income by $1; or

(b) otherwise—each 30 cents of tax offset reduces the net
exempt income by $1.
(4) You can only apply a *tax offset that you have carried forward to
the extent that it has not already been applied.
Note:

Section 65-40 contains special restrictions on applying carried forward
tax offsets.

65-40 When a company cannot apply a tax offset
(1) In working out its *tax offset for the *current year, a company
cannot apply a *tax offset it has carried forward if, assuming:
(a) the tax offset were a *tax loss of the company for the income
year in which it became entitled to the tax offset; and
(b) section 165-20 (deducting part of a tax loss) were
disregarded;
Subdivision 165-A would prevent the company from deducting it
for the current year.
Note:

Subdivision 165-A deals with the deductibility of a company’s tax
loss for an earlier income year if there has been a change in the
ownership or control of the company in the loss year or the income
year.

(2) If subsection (1) prevents the company from applying the *tax
offset, it can apply the part of the tax offset that it is reasonable to
consider relates to a part of the income year in which it became
entitled to the tax offset, but only if, assuming that part of that
income year had been treated as the whole of it, the company
would have been entitled to apply the tax offset.

65-50 Effect of bankruptcy
(1) If during the *current year:
(a) you became bankrupt; or
(b) you were released from debts under a law relating to
bankruptcy;

Section 65-55
you cannot apply a *tax offset that you have carried forward from
an earlier income year in working out the tax offset for the current
year or a later income year.
(2) Subsection (1) applies even though your bankruptcy is annulled if:
(a) the annulment happens under section 74 of the Bankruptcy
Act 1966 because your creditors have accepted your proposal
for a composition or scheme of arrangement; and
(b) under the composition or scheme of arrangement concerned,
you were, will be or may be released from debts from which
you would have been released if instead you had been
discharged from the bankruptcy.

65-55 Deduction for amounts paid for debts incurred before
bankruptcy
(1) If:
(a) you pay an amount in the *current year for a debt that you
incurred in an earlier income year; and
(b) you have a *tax offset referred to in section 65-50 for that
earlier income year;
you can deduct the amount paid, but only to the extent that it does
not exceed so much of the debt as the Commissioner is satisfied
was taken into account in calculating the amount of the tax offset.
(2) The total of the following amounts cannot exceed the total of the
expenditure that the Commissioner is satisfied was taken into
account in calculating the amount of the *tax offset that you are
unable to apply because of section 66-50:
(a) your deductions under subsection (1) for amounts paid in the
*current year or an earlier income year for debts incurred in
the income year for which you have the tax offset; and
(b) the expenditure that the Commissioner is satisfied was taken
into account in calculating any amounts of the tax offset that,
apart from section 65-50, would have been applied in
