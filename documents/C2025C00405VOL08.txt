Example 1: There are 100 shares in A Pty Ltd (the original entity), all having the
same rights. B Pty Ltd (the interposed company) acquires all the
shares in A by issuing each shareholder in A 10 shares in itself for
each share they have in A. All shares in B have the same rights. Bill
owned 15 shares in A and received 150 shares in B in exchange.
Example 2: There are 1,000 units in the A unit trust (the original entity), all having
the same rights. 2 new units in A are issued to B Pty Ltd (the
interposed company), and all other units in A are cancelled. Each
unitholder in A is issued 10 shares in B for each 100 units they have in
A. All shares in B have the same rights. Alison owned 200 units in A
and received 20 shares in B in exchange.

(3) Either:
(a) you are an Australian resident at the time your *shares or

is reasonable to treat the exchanging members as owning all
the shares.

615-30 Interposed company must make a particular choice
(1) Unless subsection (2) applies, the interposed company must choose
that section 615-65 applies.
(2) The interposed company must choose that a *consolidated group
continues in existence at and after the completion time with the
interposed company as its *head company, if:
(a) immediately before the completion time, the consolidated
group consisted of the original entity as head company and
one or more other members (the other group members); and
(b) immediately after the completion time, the interposed
company is the head company of a *consolidatable group
consisting only of itself and the other group members.
Note:

Sections 703-65 to 703-80 deal with the effects of the choice for the
consolidated group.

(3) A choice under subsection (1) or (2) must be made:
(a) within 2 months after the completion time, if the choice is
under subsection (1); or
(b) within 28 days after the completion time, if the choice is
under subsection (2); or
(c) within such further time as the Commissioner allows.

Note 1:

Apply this section separately for assets of each character.

Note 2:

The CGT exemption for trading stock does not prevent you obtaining
the roll-over (see section 615-60).

615-50 Trading stock
(1) The amount included in your assessable income because of the
disposal, redemption or cancellation of each of your *shares or
units described in paragraph 615-45(c) that was your *trading stock
at the time mentioned in that paragraph is equal to:
(a) if the share or unit had been your trading stock ever since the
start of the income year that included that time—the total of:
(i) its *value as trading stock at the start of the income year;
and
(ii) the amount (if any) by which its cost had increased
since the start of the income year; or
(b) otherwise—its cost at that time.

Note:

Generally, a capital gain or capital loss you make from a CGT asset
that you acquired before 20 September 1985 can be disregarded: see
Division 104.

(3) That number (worked out as at the completion time) is the greatest

(1) This section applies to a *CGT asset if the body *disposes of it to
the company because the body ceases to exist.
(2) The first element of the *CGT asset’s *cost base for the company is
equal to the asset’s cost base for the body in connection with the
*disposal.
(3) The first element of the *CGT asset’s *reduced cost base for the

(1) This section applies if:
(a) there is a *balancing adjustment event because the body
disposes of a *depreciating asset in an income year to the
company because the body ceases to exist; and
(b) the disposal involves a *CGT event.
(2) This Act applies as if:
(a) there were roll-over relief under subsection 40-340(1) for the
*balancing adjustment event; and
(b) the body were the transferor mentioned in that subsection and
subsection 328-243(1A); and
(c) the company were the transferee mentioned in that subsection
and subsection 328-243(1A).
Note:

Some effects of this are as follows:
(a) the balancing adjustment event does not affect the body’s
assessable income or deductions (see subsection 40-345(1));
(b) the company can deduct for the decline in value of the asset on
the same basis as the body did (see subsection 40-345(2));

700-1 What this Part is about
This Part allows certain groups of entities to be treated as single
entities for income tax purposes.
Following a choice to consolidate, subsidiary members are treated
as part of the head company of the group rather than as separate
income tax identities. The head company inherits their income tax
history when they become subsidiary members of the group. On
ceasing to be subsidiary members, they take with them an income
tax history that recognises that they are different from when they
became subsidiary members.
This is supported by rules that:
(a) set the cost for income tax purposes of assets that
subsidiary members bring into the group; and
(b) determine the income tax history that is taken into
account when entities become, or cease to be, subsidiary
members of the group; and

deal with the transfer of tax attributes such as losses and
franking credits to the head company when entities
become subsidiary members of the group.

700-5 Overview of this Part
(1) The single entity rule determines how the income tax liability of a
consolidated group will be ascertained. The basic principle is
contained in the Core Rules in Division 701.
(2) Essentially, a consolidated group consists of an Australian resident
head company and all of its Australian resident wholly-owned
subsidiaries (which may be companies, trusts or partnerships).
Special rules apply to foreign-owned groups with no single
Australian resident head company.
(3) An eligible wholly-owned group becomes a consolidated group
after notice of a choice to consolidate is given to the
Commissioner.
(4) This Part also contains rules which set the cost for income tax
purposes of assets of entities when they become subsidiary
members of a consolidated group and of membership interests in
those entities when they cease to be subsidiary members of the
group.
(5) Certain tax attributes (such as losses and franking credits) of
entities that become subsidiary members of a consolidated group
are transferred under this Part to the head company of the group.
These tax attributes remain with the group after an entity ceases to
be a subsidiary member.

realised by a consolidated group; and
(b) to prevent a double tax benefit being obtained from an
economic loss realised by a consolidated group; and
(c) to provide a systematic solution to the prevention of such
double taxation and double tax benefits that will:
(i) reduce the cost of complying with this Act; and
(ii) improve business efficiency by removing complexities
and promoting simplicity in the taxation of
wholly-owned groups.

(1) If an entity is a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated group for
any period, it and any other subsidiary member of the group are
taken for the purposes covered by subsections (2) and (3) to be
parts of the *head company of the group, rather than separate
entities, during that period.
Head company core purposes
(2) The purposes covered by this subsection (the head company core
purposes) are:
(a) working out the amount of the *head company’s liability (if
any) for income tax calculated by reference to any income
year in which any of the period occurs or any later income
year; and
(b) working out the amount of the head company’s loss (if any)
of a particular *sort for any such income year.
Note:

The single entity rule would affect the head company’s income tax
liability calculated by reference to income years after the entity ceased
to be a member of the group if, for example, assets that the entity held
when it became a subsidiary member remained with the head
company after the entity ceased to be a subsidiary member.

(1) This section has effect for the head company core purposes when
the entity becomes a *subsidiary member of the group.

(2) This section applies in relation to each asset that would be an asset
of the entity at the time it becomes a *subsidiary member of the
group, assuming that subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule)
did not apply.
Note:

See subsection 705-35(3) for the treatment of a goodwill asset
resulting from the head company’s ownership and control of the

Object
(3) The object of this section (and Division 705 which relates to it) is
to recognise the cost to the *head company of such assets as an
amount reflecting the group’s cost of acquiring the entity.

(a) the asset is *trading stock or a *registered emissions unit; and
(b) the asset’s *tax cost is set by this section at more than one
time (each of which is a setting time) for the same income
year;
then, except where subsection (6) applies, only the amount at
which the tax cost is set at the last of the setting times is to be taken
into account.

(b) the head company ceases to satisfy the requirements to be a head
company (thereby bringing the group to an end).

Object
(2) The object of this section is to preserve the alignment of the *head
company’s costs for *membership interests in each entity and its
assets by recognising, when an entity ceases to be a *subsidiary
member of the group, the cost of those interests as an amount equal
to the cost of the entity’s assets at that time reduced by the amount
of its liabilities.
Note:

The head company’s costs for membership interests in entities was
aligned with the costs of their assets when the entities became
subsidiary members of the group.

Section 701-20
Setting tax cost of membership interests
(3) For each *membership interest that the *head company of the group
holds in an entity that ceases to be a *subsidiary member, the
interest’s *tax cost is set just before the entity ceases to be a
subsidiary member at the interest’s *tax cost setting amount.
Note 1:

The membership interests would include those that are actually held
by subsidiary members of the group, but which are treated as those of
the head company under the single entity rule.

Note 2:

If the entity is a partnership, Subdivision 713-E sets the tax cost of
interests in partnership assets, rather than membership interests in the
partnership.

701-20 Cost to head company of assets consisting of certain
liabilities owed by entity that leaves group
(1) If the entity ceases to be a *subsidiary member of the group, this
section has effect for the head company core purposes, so far as
they relate to the income year in which the entity ceases to be a
subsidiary member or any later income year.
Assets to which section applies
(2) This section applies in relation to each asset, consisting of a
liability owed by the entity, that becomes an asset of the *head
company because subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule)
ceases to apply to the entity when it ceases to be a *subsidiary
member. This is a liability that, ignoring that subsection, is owed to
a *member of the group.
Object
(3) The object of this section is to set a cost for the asset to enable
income tax consequences for the *head company in respect of the
asset to be determined.

(a) either:
(i) the asset is *trading stock of the *head company; or

Entity rules
701-30 Where entity not subsidiary member for whole of income
year
Object
(1) The object of this section is to provide for a method of working out
how the entity core rules apply to the entity for periods in the
income year when the entity is not part of the group. The method
involves treating each period separately with no netting off
between them.
When section has effect
(2) This section has effect for the entity core purposes if:
(a) the entity is a *subsidiary member of the group for some but
not all of an income year; and
(b) there are one or more periods in the income year (each of
which is a non-membership period) during which the entity
is not a subsidiary member of any *consolidated group.
Tax position of each non-membership period to be worked out
(3) For every non-membership period, work out the entity’s taxable
income (if any) for the period, the income tax (if any) payable on
that taxable income and the entity’s loss (if any) (a
non-membership period loss) of each *sort for the period. Work
them out:
(a) as if the start and end of the period were the start and end of
the income year; and
(b) ignoring the operation of this section in relation to each other
non-membership period (if any); and
(c) so that each relevant item is either:
(i) allocated to only one of the non-membership periods or
to a period that is all or part of the rest of the income
year; or

(ii) apportioned among such periods (for example, by
Subdivision 716-A (see note to this subsection)).
Note:

Other provisions of this Part are to be applied in working out the
taxable income or loss, for example:
•
section 701-40 (Exit history rule); and
•
Subdivision 716-A (about assessable income and deductions
spread over several membership or non-membership periods);
and
•
section 716-850 (about grossing up threshold amounts for
periods of less than 365 days).
Subdivision 716 also affects the tax position of the head company of a
group of which the entity has been a subsidiary member for some but
not all of the income year.

(3A) For the purposes of working out the entity’s taxable income (if
any) for the non-membership period, determine:
(a) whether the entity can *utilise a loss of any *sort transferred
to the entity in the period; and
(b) if the period started at the start of the income year—whether
the entity can utilise a loss of any sort:
(i) made by the entity, without a transfer, for an earlier
income year; or
(ii) transferred to the entity in an earlier income year;
as if the time just after the end of the period were the end of the
income year and the entity carried on at that time the same business
that it carried on just before that time. Paragraph (3)(a) has effect
subject to this subsection.
Note:

This means that things that happen in relation to the entity at the time
it becomes a subsidiary member of the group are taken into account in
determining whether the entity can utilise such a loss to affect its
taxable income for the non-membership period.

Income tax for the financial year
(4) The entity’s income tax (if any) for the *financial year concerned is
the total of every amount of income tax worked out for the entity
under subsection (3).

Section 701-30
Taxable income for the income year
(5) The entity’s taxable income for the income year is the total of
every amount of taxable income worked out for the entity under
subsection (3).
(6) The entity’s income tax worked out under subsection (4) is taken to
be payable on the entity’s taxable income for the income year
worked out under subsection (5), even if the amount of the tax
differs from the amount that would be worked out by reference to
that taxable income apart from subsection (5).
Loss for the income year
(7) The entity has a loss of a particular *sort for the income year if and
only if it has a non-membership period loss of that sort for the
non-membership period (if any) ending at the end of the income
year. The amount of the loss for the income year is the amount of
the non-membership period loss.
Utilisation and transfer of non-membership period loss
(8) However, the provisions of this Act relating to transfer or
*utilisation of a loss of any *sort have effect in relation to a
non-membership period loss of that sort for any non-membership
period as if the non-membership period loss were the entity’s loss
for an income year that:

(b) ended at the end of the period.

also (despite subsection (2)) for other purposes.

income year after the income year (the current income year) to
which this section applies, the entity has an excess mentioned in

when it joins group
(1) When the entity becomes a *subsidiary member of the group, this
section has effect for the entity core purposes.

(2) This section applies in relation to an asset if:
(a) the asset is *trading stock of the entity just before it becomes
a *subsidiary member of the group; or
(b) the asset is:
(i) a *registered emissions unit; and
(ii) an asset of the entity;

Object
(3) The object of this section is to ensure that there is no income tax
consequence for the entity in respect of the asset.
Note:

In the case of assets other than trading stock or registered emissions
units, the fact that the entity ceases to hold them when the single entity
rule begins to apply to them would not constitute a disposal or other
event having tax consequences for the entity.

(b) any liability or other thing that, in accordance with
*accounting principles, is a liability;
(c) any business;
that becomes that of the entity because subsection 701-1(1) (the

Head company history inherited
(3) Everything that happened in relation to any eligible asset etc. while
it was that of the *head company, including because of any
application of section 701-5 (the entry history rule), is taken to
have happened in relation to it as if it had been an eligible asset etc.

Note 1:

If the eligible asset etc. was brought into the group when an entity
became a subsidiary member, section 701-5 (the entry history rule)

if it was that of the head company. Such things will in turn be taken by
this subsection to have happened in relation to the eligible asset etc. as
if it were that of the entity that takes the asset out of the group.

Object
(3) The object of this section is to set the cost of the asset to enable
income tax consequences for the entity in respect of the asset to be
determined.
Note:

In the case of other assets, the fact that the entity inherits their history
under section 701-40 when the entity ceases to be a subsidiary
member of the group means that the assets would be treated as having
the same cost as they would for the head company at that time.
However, assets consisting of liabilities do not have such a history
because they are only recognised when the entity ceases to be a
subsidiary member and the single entity rule ceases to apply.

Setting the asset’s tax cost
(4) The asset’s *tax cost is set at the time the entity ceases to be a
*subsidiary member of the group at the asset’s *tax cost setting
amount.
Note 1:

If section 701-30 (Where entity not subsidiary member for whole of

member will be treated as the start of an income year.

(1) This section applies if:
(a) the *tax cost of an asset was set at the time (the joining time)
an entity became a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated
group, at the asset’s *tax cost setting amount; and
(b) ignoring the operation of subsection 701-1(1) (the single

Note 1:

If expenditure incurred under an arrangement consists of a payment of
loan interest or a payment of a similar kind, the expenditure would be
incurred in return for the making available or continued making
available of the loan principal, or other amount of a similar kind,
under the arrangement.

Note 2:

If expenditure incurred under an arrangement consists of a payment of

An example of such a provision is Division 707 (about the transfer of
certain losses to the head company of a consolidated group). That
Division modifies the effect that the inheritance of history rule in

703-5 What is a consolidated group?
(1) A consolidated group comes into existence:
(a) on the day specified in a choice by a company under
section 703-50 as the day on and after which a
*consolidatable group is taken to be consolidated; or
(b) as described in section 703-55 (about creating a consolidated
group from a *MEC group).
Note:

The day specified in a choice under section 703-50 as the day on and
after which a consolidatable group is taken to be consolidated may be
a day before the choice is made.

(2) The consolidated group continues to exist until the *head company
of the group:
(a) ceases to be a head company; or
(b) becomes a member of a *MEC group.

Division 703 Consolidated groups and their members

Section 703-10
The consolidated group ceases to exist when one of those events
happens to the head company.
Note:

The group does not cease to exist in some cases where a shelf
company is interposed between the head company and its former
members: see subsection 615-30(2) and section 703-70.

(3) At any time while it is in existence, the consolidated group
consists of the *head company and all of the *subsidiary members
(if any) of the group at the time.
Note:

A consolidated group continues to exist despite one or more entities
ceasing to be subsidiary members of the group or becoming
subsidiaries of the group, as long as the events described in
subsection (2) do not happen to the head company. Thus a
consolidated group may come to consist of a head company alone at
various times.

703-10 What is a consolidatable group?
(1) A consolidatable group consists of:
(a) a single *head company; and
(b) all the *subsidiary members of the group.
(2) To avoid doubt, a consolidatable group cannot consist of a *head
company alone.

703-15 Members of a consolidated group or consolidatable group
(1) An entity is a member of a *consolidated group or *consolidatable
group while the entity is:
(a) the *head company of the group; or
(b) a *subsidiary member of the group.
(2) At a particular time in an income year, an entity is:
(a) a head company if all the requirements in item 1 of the table
are met in relation to the entity; or
(b) a subsidiary member of a *consolidated group or
*consolidatable group if all the requirements in item 2 of the
table are met in relation to the entity:

703-35 Treating entities as wholly-owned subsidiaries by
disregarding employee shares
(1) The object of this section is to ensure that an entity (the first entity)
is not prevented from being a *subsidiary member of a
*consolidated group or *consolidatable group just because there are
minor holdings of *membership interests in an entity (the employee
share scheme entity) issued under *arrangements for employee
shareholdings. (It does not matter whether the employee share
scheme entity is the first entity or is interposed between the first
entity and a *member of the group.)
Note:

A company that is prevented from being a subsidiary member of a
consolidated group may be a head company (so there could be 2
consolidated or consolidatable groups, instead of the one that this
section ensures exists).

(2) This Part (except Division 719) operates as if an entity that meets
the requirement of subsection (3) at a particular time were a
*wholly-owned subsidiary of an entity (the holding entity) at the
time.
(3) The entity must be one that would be a *wholly-owned subsidiary
of the holding entity at the time if the *membership interests in the
entity that are to be disregarded under subsection (4) did not exist.
(4) Disregard:
(a) each of the *shares described in subsection (5) if the total
number of those shares is not more than 1% of the number of
ordinary shares in the company; and
(b) each of the *membership interests in an entity described in
subsection (5) if the total number of those membership
interests is not more than 1% of the number of membership
interests of that kind in the entity.
(5) A *share or *membership interest in a company may be disregarded
under subsection (4) if:
(a) the entity who holds the beneficial interest in the share or
membership interest acquired that beneficial interest:

(c) in the case of a membership interest—the interest is part of a

703-37 Disregarding certain preference shares following an ADI
restructure
(1) The object of this section is to ensure that, following an *ADI
restructure to which Part 4A of the Financial Sector (Transfer and
Restructure) Act 1999 applies, a body corporate is not prevented
from being a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated group or
*consolidatable group just because the body (or another body
corporate) has issued, or issues, certain preference *shares.
(2) This Part (except Division 719) operates as if a body corporate that
meets the requirement of subsection (3) at a particular time were a
*wholly-owned subsidiary of another body corporate (the holding
body) at the time.
(3) The body corporate (the preference-share issuing body) must be
one that would be a *wholly-owned subsidiary of the holding body
at the time if the *shares in the preference share-issuing body that
are to be disregarded under subsection (4) did not exist.
(4) Disregard a *share in the preference-share issuing body if:
(a) a restructure instrument under Part 4A of the Financial
Sector (Transfer and Restructure) Act 1999 is in force in
relation to a non-operating holding company within the
meaning of that Act; and
(b) because of the restructure to which the instrument relates, an
*ADI becomes a subsidiary (within the meaning of that Act)
of the non-operating holding company; and

met for an entity (the test entity) to be a *subsidiary member of a
*consolidated group or a *consolidatable group at a particular time
(the test time).
(2) At the test time, each of the interposed entities must either:
(a) be a *subsidiary member of the group; or
(b) hold *membership interests in:

(ii) a subsidiary member of the group interposed between
the *head company of the group and the test entity;
only as a nominee of one or more entities each of which is a

(1) A company may make a choice in writing that a *consolidatable
group is taken to be consolidated on and after a day that is
specified in the choice and is after 30 June 2002, if the company
was the *head company of the group on the day specified.

*consolidated group is to continue in existence at and after the time
referred to in that subsection as the completion time.
Note:

The choice is one of the conditions for a compulsory roll-over under
Division 615 on an exchange of shares in the head company of a
consolidated group for shares in the interposed company.

Part 3-90 Consolidated groups
Division 703 Consolidated groups and their members

Section 703-70
703-70 Consolidated group continues in existence with interposed
company as head company and original entity as a
subsidiary member
(1) The *consolidated group is taken not to have ceased to exist under
subsection 703-5(2) because the company referred to in
subsection 615-30(2) as the original entity ceases to be the *head
company of the group.
(2) To avoid doubt, the interposed company is taken to have become
the *head company of the *consolidated group at the completion
time, and the original entity is taken to have ceased to be the head
company at that time.
Note:

A further result is that the original entity is taken to have become a
subsidiary member of the group at that time. Section 703-80 deals
with the original entity’s tax position for the income year that includes
the completion time.

(3) A provision of this Part that applies on an entity becoming a
*subsidiary member of a *consolidated group does not apply to an
entity being taken to have become such a member as a result of this
section, unless the provision is expressed to apply despite this
subsection.
Note:

An example of the effect of this subsection is that there is no resetting
under section 701-10 of the tax cost of assets of the original entity that
become assets of the interposed company because of
subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule).

(4) To avoid doubt, subsection (3) does not affect the application of
subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule).

703-75 Interposed company treated as substituted for original entity
at all times before the completion time
(1) Everything that happened in relation to the original entity before
the completion time:
(a) is taken to have happened in relation to the interposed
company instead of in relation to the original entity; and

before that time;
just as if, at all times before the completion time:
(c) the interposed company had been the original entity; and
(d) the original entity had been the interposed company.
Note:

This section treats the original entity and the interposed company as
having in effect exchanged identities throughout the period before the
completion time, but without affecting any of the original entity’s
other attributes.

(2) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) also covers everything that,
immediately before the completion time, was taken, because of:
(a) section 701-1 (Single entity rule); or
(b) section 701-5 (Entry history rule); or
(c) one or more previous applications of this section; or
(d) section 719-90 (about the effects of a change of head

involving a MEC group);
to have happened in relation to the original entity.
(3) Subsections (1) and (2) have effect:
(a) for the head company core purposes in relation to an income
year ending after the completion time; and
(b) for the entity core purposes in relation to an income year
ending after the completion time; and
(c) for the purposes of determining the respective balances of the
*franking accounts of the original entity and the interposed
company at and after the completion time.
(4) Subsections (1) and (2) have effect subject to:
(a) section 701-40 (Exit history rule); and

because of section 701-85 (about exceptions to the core rules

Note:

An example of provisions covered by paragraph (b) of this subsection
is Subdivision 717-E (about transferring to a company leaving a
consolidated group various surpluses under the CFC rules in Part X of
the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936).

703-80 Effects on the original entity’s tax position
In applying section 701-30 to the original entity for the income
year that includes the completion time, disregard a
non-membership period that starts before the completion time.
Note 1:

Section 701-30 is about working out an entity’s tax position for a
period when it is not a subsidiary member of any consolidated group.
Its application can also affect the entity’s tax position in later income
years.

Note 2:

Under section 703-75 the interposed company inherits the original
entity’s tax position for the part of the income year that ends before
the completion time, with the consequence that the original entity’s
taxable income, income tax payable, and losses of any sort, for that
part are each nil.
Because of section 703-75 and this section, the only tax payable by
the original entity for the income year arises because of the
application of section 701-30 to non-membership periods in the
income year after the completion time.

Application
(1) This Subdivision has effect, subject to section 705-15, for the head

(the joining entity) becomes a *subsidiary member of a
*consolidated group (the joined group) at a particular time (the
joining time).
Object
(2) The object of this Subdivision is to recognise the *head company’s
cost of becoming the holder of the joining entity’s assets as an
amount reflecting the group’s cost of acquiring the entity. That
amount consists of the cost of the group’s *membership interests in

the joining entity, increased by the joining entity’s liabilities and
adjusted to take account of the joining entity’s retained profits,
distributions of profits, deductions and losses.
(3) The reason for recognising the *head company’s cost in this way is
to align the costs of assets with the costs of *membership interests,
and to allow for the preservation of this alignment until the entity
ceases to be a *subsidiary member, in order to:
(a) prevent double taxation of gains and duplication of losses;
and
(b) remove the need to adjust costs of membership interests in
response to transactions that shift value between them, as the
required adjustments occur automatically.
Note:

Under Division 711, the alignment is preserved by recognising the
head company’s cost of membership interests in the entity if it ceases
to be a subsidiary member of the group as the cost of its assets
reduced by its liabilities.

705-15 Cases where this Subdivision does not have effect
This Subdivision does not have effect if any of the following
exceptions applies:
(a) the first exception is where the joining entity becomes a
*member of the joined group because it is a member of that
group at the time it comes into existence as a *consolidated
group;
Note:

See Subdivision 705-B for rules about the treatment of assets if
entities become members in circumstances covered by this
exception.

(b) the second exception is where all of the members of another
consolidated group become members of the joined group as a
result of the *acquisition of *membership interests in the
*head company of the joining group;
Note:

See Subdivision 705-C for rules about the treatment of assets if
entities become members in circumstances covered by this
exception.

(c) the third exception is where:

If this Subdivision has effect, for the purposes of item 1 in the table
in section 701-60 (Tax cost setting amount) the *tax cost setting
amount for an asset whose *tax cost is set at the time the joining
entity becomes a *subsidiary member of the joined group is worked
out under this Subdivision.

(1) This section states what the *tax cost setting amount is for a
*retained cost base asset.
Australian currency
(2) If the *retained cost base asset is covered by paragraph (a), (b) or
(ba) of the definition of that expression and is not covered by
another subsection of this section, its *tax cost setting amount is
equal to the amount of the Australian currency concerned.
Qualifying securities
(3) If the *retained cost base asset is a qualifying security (within the
meaning of Division 16E of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment
Act 1936), the *tax cost setting amount for the qualifying security
is instead equal to the joining entity’s *terminating value for the
asset.

been reduced under subsection 705-75(2);
reduce the amount of the reduction under subsection (1) by the
amount of the deduction (but not below zero).
(3) If the *tax cost setting amount of 2 or more of the joining entity’s
assets could be reduced in accordance with subsections (1) and (2):
(a) subsections (1) and (2) apply sequentially to each of those
assets; and
(b) the *head company may choose the sequence of assets to
which subsections (1) and (2) apply; and
(c) if the head company does not make such a choice—
subsections (1) and (2) apply sequentially to each of those
assets according to the time at which they were created, from
earliest to latest.
Note:

Once the amount of the capital gain is reduced to nil as a result of the
application of subsections (1) and (2), no further reductions of tax cost
setting amount can be made under those subsections.

(4) A choice the *head company can make under paragraph (3)(b)
must be made:
(a) by the day the head company lodges its *income tax return
for the income year in which the *CGT event happened; or
(b) within a further time allowed by the Commissioner.
(5) The way the *head company prepares its *income tax return is
sufficient evidence of the making of the choice.

705-30 What is the joining entity’s terminating value for an asset?
Trading stock
(1) If an asset of the joining entity is *trading stock, the joining entity’s
terminating value for the asset is:
(a) if the asset was on hand at the start of the income year in
which the joining time occurs (including because of the
operation of Division 701)—its *value at that time; or
(b) if paragraph (a) does not apply and the asset is *live stock
that was acquired by natural increase—the *cost of the asset;
or
(c) in any other case—the amount of the outgoing incurred by
the joining entity in connection with the acquisition of the
asset;
increased by the amount of any outgoing forming part of the cost
of the asset that is incurred by the joining entity during its current
holding of the asset.
Registered emissions units
(1A) If an asset of the joining entity is a *registered emissions unit, the
joining entity’s terminating value for the unit is equal to:
(a) if the unit was *held by the joining entity at the start of the
income year—the *value of the unit at the start of the income
year; or
(b) otherwise—the expenditure incurred by the joining entity in
becoming the holder of the unit.
Qualifying securities
(2) If an asset of the joining entity is a qualifying security (within the
meaning of Division 16E of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment
Act 1936) that is not *trading stock, the joining entity’s
terminating value for the asset is equal to the amount of
consideration that the joining entity would need to receive, if it
were to dispose of the asset just before the joining time, without an

entity under section 159GS of the Income Tax Assessment Act
1936.
Depreciating assets
(3) If an asset of the joining entity is a *depreciating asset to which
Division 40 applies, the joining entity’s terminating value for the
asset is equal to the asset’s *adjustable value just before the joining
time.
Financial arrangements to which Subdivision 250-E applies
(3A) If an asset of the joining entity is a *financial arrangement to which
Subdivision 250-E applies, the joining entity’s terminating value
for the asset is equal to the amount of consideration that the joining
entity would need to receive, if it were to dispose of the asset just
before the joining time, without an amount being assessable
income of, or deductible to, the joining entity under
Subdivision 250-E.
Division 230 financial arrangements

financial arrangement, the joining entity’s terminating value for the
asset is equal to the amount of consideration that the joining entity
would need to receive, if it were to dispose of the asset just before
the joining time, without an amount being assessable income of, or
deductible to, the joining entity under Division 230.
Other CGT assets
(4) If an asset of the joining entity is a *CGT asset that is not covered
by any of the above subsections, the joining entity’s terminating
value for the asset is equal to the asset’s *cost base just before the
joining time.

Section 705-35
Other assets
(5) The joining entity’s terminating value for any other asset that it
holds is the amount that would be the asset’s *cost base just before
the joining time if it were an asset covered by subsection (4).

705-35 Tax cost setting amount for reset cost base assets
(1) For each asset of the joining entity (a reset cost base asset) that is
not a *retained cost base asset, the asset’s *tax cost setting amount
is worked out by:
(a) first working out the joined group’s *allocable cost amount
for the joining entity in accordance with section 705-60; and
(b) then reducing that amount by the total of the *tax cost setting
amounts for each retained cost base asset (but not below
zero); and
(c) finally, allocating the result to each of the joining entity’s
reset cost base assets in proportion to their *market values.
Note 1:

For an asset consisting of an entitlement to receive an amount that will
be included in assessable income, the market value of the asset would
take into account the tax payable on the amount.

Note 1A:

If a set of linked assets and liabilities includes one or more reset cost
base assets, section 705-59 may affect how this section applies. In
particular, that section may exclude the application of
paragraph 705-35(1)(b) to retained cost base assets in the set; this in
turn may affect the application of CGT event L3.

Note 2:

If there are no reset cost base assets, the result is instead treated as a
capital loss of the head company: see CGT event L4.

Goodwill resulting from ownership and control of the joining entity
(3) If, just after the joining time, the *head company has, because of its
ownership and control of the joining entity, a goodwill asset
associated with assets or businesses of the joined group:
(a) for the head company core purposes, the asset’s *tax cost is
set at the joining time at its *tax cost setting amount; and
(b) for the purpose of doing so:

Section 705-40
(i) the asset is taken to be an asset of the joining entity that
becomes an asset of the head company because
subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) applies; and
(ii) it is taken to have a *market value just before the joining
time of an amount equal to its market value just after the
joining time.

705-40 Tax cost setting amount for reset cost base assets held on
revenue account etc.
(1) The *tax cost setting amount for a reset cost base asset that is
*trading stock, a *depreciating asset, a *registered emissions unit or
a *revenue asset must not exceed the greater of:
(a) the asset’s *market value; and
(b) the joining entity’s *terminating value for the asset.
(2) If subsection (1) reduces the asset’s *tax cost setting amount, the
amount of the reduction is allocated among the other reset cost
base assets (including other *trading stock, *depreciating assets,
*registered emissions units and *revenue assets), so as to increase
their tax cost setting amounts, in accordance with the principles set
out in subsection (3).
Note:

If any of the amount of the reduction cannot be allocated, it is instead
treated as a capital loss of the head company: see CGT event L8.

(3) These are the principles:
(a) the allocation is to be in proportion to the *market values of
the assets;
(b) the amount allocated to an item of *trading stock, to a
*depreciating asset, to a *registered emissions unit or to a
*revenue asset must not cause its *tax cost setting amount to
contravene subsection (1);
(c) any of the amount that cannot be allocated is to be
reallocated, to the maximum extent possible, among the
remaining reset cost base assets by applying this subsection a
further one or more times.

(1) If:
(a) an asset of the joining entity is a *depreciating asset to which
Division 40 applies; and
(aa) just before the entity became a subsidiary member,
subsection 40-10(3) or 40-12(3) of the Income Tax

of the joining entity working out the asset’s decline in value
under Division 40; and
Note:

The effect of those subsections was to preserve an entitlement to
accelerated depreciation.

(b) the asset’s *tax cost setting amount would be greater than the
joining entity’s *terminating value for the asset; and
(c) the *head company chooses to apply this section to the asset;
the asset’s tax cost setting amount is reduced so that it equals the
terminating value.
Note 1:

A consequence of the choice is that accelerated depreciation will
apply to the asset: see section 701-80.

Object
(1) The object of this section is to limit appropriately the amount the
*head company of the joined group can deduct for a *depreciating
asset it starts to *hold because the joining entity becomes a
*subsidiary member of the group, by reference to the direct or
indirect effect of the following provisions on the amount the
joining entity could deduct for the asset:
(a) former section 61A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936
(about depreciation deductions for tax-exempt entities that
become taxable);
(b) former Subdivision 57-I, and Subdivision 57-J, in
Schedule 2D to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (about

Former section 61A of, or former Subdivision 57-I or
Subdivision 57-J in Schedule 2D to, the Income Tax Assessment Act
1936 or Division 58 of this Act may, for example, have indirectly
affected the amount the joining entity could deduct for the asset
because:
(a) that section, Subdivision or Division affected the amount that
could be deducted by an entity that held the asset before the
joining entity and that effect extended to the joining entity
because of a previous application of this subsection, roll-over
relief or section 701-40 (the exit history rule); or
(b) this subsection affected the amount the joining entity could
deduct for the asset (either directly or because of section 701-40).

Subsection (2) has effect even if, just before the joining time, the
joining entity was:
(a) an exempt Australian government agency; or

Exception to reduction of tax cost setting amount
(3) Subsection (2) does not apply if:
(a) just before the joining time, the joining entity was neither an
*exempt Australian government agency nor another entity
whose *ordinary income and *statutory income were exempt
from income tax; and
(b) a condition in subsection (4) or (5) is met in relation to the

status of membership interests in joining entity
Object
(1) The object of this section is to ensure that provisions that cause
*membership interests in the joining entity to stop being *pre-CGT
assets, with a resultant increase in their *cost base and *reduced
cost base, do not increase *tax cost setting amounts for *trading
stock, *depreciating assets, *registered emissions units or *revenue

When section applies
(2) This section applies if:
(a) a *membership interest that a *member of the joined group
holds in the joining entity at the joining time had previously
stopped being a *pre-CGT asset in the circumstances covered
by any of subsections (3) to (5); and
(b) the *cost base or *reduced cost base of the membership
interest just after it stopped being a pre-CGT asset exceeded
(the excess being the loss of pre-CGT status adjustment
amount) its cost base or reduced cost base just before it
stopped being a pre-CGT asset; and
(c) an asset (a revenue etc. asset) that is *trading stock, a
*depreciating asset, a *registered emissions unit or a *revenue
asset becomes that of the *head company of the joined group
because subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) applies

(d) the revenue etc. asset’s *tax cost setting amount (after any
application of section 705-40, 705-45 or 705-47) exceeds the

Reduction in revenue etc. asset’s tax cost setting amount
(6) The revenue etc. asset’s *tax cost setting amount (after any
application of section 705-40, 705-45 or 705-47) is instead the
amount that would apply if, in working out the step 1 amount in the

*membership interest were reduced by the sum of the loss of
pre-CGT status adjustment amounts for the membership interest
and all other membership interests that have loss of pre-CGT status
adjustment amounts.
Limit on reduction
(7) However, the reduction only takes place to the extent that it does
not result in the asset’s *tax cost setting amount being less than the
joining entity’s *terminating value for the asset.

The reduction under this section is converted into a capital loss
available over a period of 5 income years starting with the income

Working out the joined group’s allocable cost amount for the joining entity
Step

What the step requires

Purpose of the step

1

Start with the step 1 amount worked
out under section 705-65, which is
about the cost of *membership interests
in the joining entity held by *members
of the joined group

To ensure that the allocable cost
amount includes the cost of
*acquiring the membership
interests

2

Add to the result of step 1 the step 2
amount worked out under
section 705-70, which is about the
value of the joining entity’s liabilities

To ensure that the joining entity’s
liabilities at the joining time,
which are part of the joined

taken into account in working out the first element of the cost
base or reduced cost base of the membership interest;
Note:

This would be the case if the money was only to be paid etc. if a
contingency happened after the joining time.

the thing is nevertheless so taken into account, and taken always to
have been so taken into account.
Non-membership equity interests
(6) For the purposes of this section, if at the joining time a *member of
the joined group holds a *non-membership equity interest in the
joining entity, that non-membership equity interest is treated as if it
were a *membership interest in the joining entity.

705-70 Liabilities of the joining entity—step 2 in working out
allocable cost amount
(1) For the purposes of step 2 in the table in section 705-60, the step 2
amount is worked out by adding up the amounts of each thing (an
accounting liability) that, in accordance with the joining entity’s
*accounting principles for tax cost setting, is a liability of the
joining entity at the joining time.
Note:

Certain liabilities of a life insurance company are worked out under
Subdivision 713-L: see section 713-520.

Exclusion for deferred tax liability
(1B) An amount is not to be added for an accounting liability that is an
amount recorded in a deferred tax liability account in accordance
with the joining entity’s *accounting principles for tax cost setting.

Application
(1A) This section applies to an accounting liability to the extent that it is
a liability of a kind described in:
(a) paragraph 705-70(1AC)(c); or
(b) paragraph 705-70(1AC)(d).
Adjustment for unrealised gains and losses

(a) for income tax purposes, an accounting liability, or a change
in the amount of an accounting liability, (other than one
owed to a *member of the joined group) is taken into account
at a later time than is the case in accordance with the joining
entity’s *accounting principles for tax cost setting; and
(b) assuming that, for income tax purposes the accounting
liability or change were taken into account at the same time
as is the case in accordance with those standards or
statements, the joined group’s allocable cost amount would
be different;
Note:

The difference would arise because subsection 705-70(1)
includes income tax liabilities and steps 3 and 5 of the table in
section 705-60 are affected by the time at which changes in
liabilities are taken into account for income tax purposes.

reliable basis for estimation that is available.
Example: The amount of a change in liability for employee leave entitlements
over a period.

step 2 in working out allocable cost amount
Increase in step 2 amount for employee share interests
(1) If any *membership interest (an employee share interest) in the
joining entity needed to be disregarded under section 703-35 in
order for the joining entity to be a *wholly-owned subsidiary of the
*head company at the joining time, the step 2 amount worked out
under section 705-70 is increased by the sum of the *market values
of those interests, reduced in each case by the reduction amount (if
any) worked out under subsection (2) of this section.
Reduction amount
(2) There is a reduction amount if the *market value of the employee
share interest at the time it was *acquired by the employee is more
than the consideration paid or given for its acquisition. The
reduction amount is worked out by multiplying the market value of
the employee share interest at that time by the factor worked out

would arise if the following were paid just before the joining time:
(a) the income tax, or refund of income tax, on the joining
entity’s taxable income for that income year; and
(b) any income tax, or refund of income tax, that has not yet

in working out allocable cost amount
For the purposes of step 4 in the table in section 705-60, the step 4
amount is the sum of all distributions made by the joining entity
before the joining time that:
(a) the *head company receives directly, or would receive
indirectly if entities interposed between the head company
and the joining entity successively distributed any
distribution they received immediately after receiving it; and
(b) were made out of profits:
(i) that did not accrue to the joined group before the joining
time (see subsection 705-90(7)); or
(ii) that accrued to the joined group before the joining time
and recouped losses of any *sort that accrued to the
joined group before that time (see
subsection 705-90(8)).
Note:

As well as subsection 705-90(7), paragraph 705-90(9)(b) and
subsection 705-90(10) are relevant to working out whether or not
profits accrued to the joined group before the joining time.

in working out allocable cost amount
(1) For the purposes of step 5 in the table in section 705-60, the step 5
amount is the sum of all losses of any *sort of the joining entity
that:
(a) had not been *utilised by the joining entity for the income
year in which the joining time occurred or any earlier income
year; and

5A amount is the sum of all *FRT disallowed amounts of the
joining entity that:
(a) had not been applied by the joining entity under
paragraph 820-56(2)(b) for the income year in which the

If:
(a) a *membership interest that a *member of the joined group
held in the joining entity at the joining time was taken under
this Act to have been *acquired by the member for its
*market value at a particular time (the market value time); or
(b) the *cost base and *reduced cost base of a membership

Section 705-125

How to work out a pre-CGT factor for assets of joining entity
705-125 Pre-CGT proportion for joining entity
Object
(1) Because intra-group *membership interests in the joining entity are
disregarded under subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule), the
object of this section is to provide a mechanism to ensure that the
benefit of the pre-CGT status of those interests is not lost. That
mechanism involves:
(a) working out the proportion (measured by market value) of
the membership interests in the joining entity that have
pre-CGT status; and
(b) if the joining entity later ceases being a member of the group,
attaching pre-CGT status to that proportion of membership
interests in it (see section 711-65), subject to integrity rules
(see section 711-70).
How to work out pre-CGT proportion
(2) The pre-CGT proportion is the amount worked out by dividing:
(a) the sum of the *market value of each *membership interest in
the joining entity that is:
(i) held by a *member of the group at the joining time; and
(ii) is a *pre-CGT asset;
by:
(b) the sum of the market value of each membership interest in
the joining entity that is held by a member of the group at the
joining time.
Modification if joining entity is a trust
(4) If the joining entity is a trust, a *membership interest in it is not
taken into account under subsection (2) unless the membership
interest is either a unit or an interest in the trust.

Section 705-135

Application and object
705-135 Application and object of this Subdivision
Application
(1) This Subdivision has effect for the head company core purposes set
out in subsection 701-1(2) if one or more entities become
*subsidiary members of a *consolidated group at the time (the
formation time) it comes into existence as a consolidated group.
Note:

This is the first exception to Subdivision 705-A: see
paragraph 705-15(a).

Object
(2) The object of this Subdivision is to modify the rules in
Subdivision 705-A (which basically determine the tax cost setting
amount for assets of an entity joining an existing *consolidated
group) so that they have effect, and take account of different
circumstances that apply, when a consolidated group comes into
existence.
Note:

The main circumstance is where one of the entities has membership
interests in another. In such a case, the order in which the rules in
Subdivision 705-A are applied will affect the tax cost setting amounts
for the assets of the entities.

Modified application of Subdivision 705-A
705-140 Subdivision 705-A has effect with modifications
(1) Subdivision 705-A has effect in relation to each entity becoming a
*subsidiary member of the *consolidated group at the formation
time in the same way as that Subdivision has effect in relation to an
entity becoming a subsidiary member of a consolidated group in
circumstances covered by that Subdivision.
(2) However, that effect of Subdivision 705-A is subject to
modifications set out in this Subdivision.

Section 705-145
705-145 Order in which tax cost setting amounts are to be worked
out where subsidiary members have membership
interests in other subsidiary members
Object
(1) The object of this section is to ensure that where, on becoming
*subsidiary members, entities hold assets consisting of
*membership interests in other subsidiary members, the *head
company’s cost of becoming the holder of the assets of all of the
entities that become subsidiary members correctly reflects the
group’s cost of acquiring the entities.
Tax cost setting amounts to be worked out from top down
(2) If, on becoming *subsidiary members, entities hold *membership
interests in any other entities that become subsidiary members, the
*tax cost setting amounts for the assets of entities holding
membership interests must be worked out before the tax cost
setting amounts for the assets of the entities in which the
membership interests are held.
Note:

The tax cost setting amount in respect of assets of any subsidiary
member in which the head company, but no other subsidiary member,
holds membership interests can be worked out in any order in relation
to the calculations for other subsidiary members.

Tax cost setting amount for higher entity’s membership interests to
be used in working out lower entity’s tax cost setting amount
(3) The tax cost setting amount worked out for assets of an entity
mentioned in subsection (2) consisting of *membership interests in
another such entity is to be used as the amount for those interests
under subsection 705-65(1) (step 1 of allocable cost amount) in
working out the tax cost setting amount for assets of that other
entity.
Note 1:

Subsection 705-65(1) adds together amounts worked out in
accordance with section 705-65 representing the cost of the
membership interests that each member of the group holds in the
entity. If any of those membership interests is held by another

otherwise applicable with the tax cost setting amount that will have
been worked out for the interests in accordance with subsection (2)
above.
Note 2:

The tax cost setting amount worked out for the membership interests
has no relevance other than for the purpose mentioned in
subsection (3). This is because, under the single entity principle, intra
group membership interests are ignored while entities are members of
the group. If an entity ceases to be a member, section 701-15 and
Division 711 set the tax cost of membership interests in the entity at
that time.

Value shifting etc. provisions not to apply to later CGT events
involving membership interests
(4) However, despite subsection (3), subsection 705-65(4) (which
prevents the later operation of value shifting etc. provisions) still
applies to the *membership interests.
Non-membership equity interests
(5) For the purposes of this section, if, on becoming a *subsidiary
member, an entity holds a *non-membership equity interest in
another entity that becomes a subsidiary member at the same time,
that non-membership equity interest is treated as if it were a
*membership interest in that other entity.

accordance with this Subdivision so that it takes account of
*membership interests that entities that become *subsidiary
members hold in other such entities.

working out the group’s *allocable cost amount for an entity
(the subject entity) that becomes a *subsidiary member of the

(b) at that time one or more entities (the first level entities), that
become subsidiary members of the group and in which the
*head company holds *membership interests, are interposed

then the step 3A amount is apportioned among the first level
entities and the subject entity on the following basis:
(c) each first level entity has the following proportion of the step
3A amount:
*Market value of first level entity's

interests in subject entity
*Market value of all membership
interests in subject entity

where:
market value of all membership interests in subject entity
means the *market value, at the formation time, of all
*membership interests in the subject entity that are held by
entities that become *members of the group at that time.
market value of first level entity’s direct and indirect
membership interests in subject entity means so much of the
*market value of all membership interests in the subject
entity (as defined above) as is attributable to *membership
interests that the first level entity holds directly, or indirectly
through other interposed entities that become *subsidiary
members of the group at the formation time; and

members of the group at the formation time, the reduction under
step 4 in the table in section 705-60 (about pre-formation time

have been effectively distributed to the *head company in respect
of its direct *membership interests in the entities. This ensures
consistency with the ordering rule in section 705-145.

(2) This section applies to a distribution (the subject distribution) to
the extent that the following conditions are satisfied:
(a) the distribution is made by an entity (the subject entity) that
becomes a *subsidiary member of the group at the formation
time;
(b) in working out the group’s *allocable cost amount for the
subject entity there would, apart from this section, be a
reduction under step 4 in the table in section 705-60 for the

Section 705-163
705-163 Modified application of section 705-57
Object
(1) The object of this section is to ensure that, in working out *tax cost
setting amounts for *trading stock, *depreciating assets, *registered
emissions units or *revenue assets of entities that become
*subsidiary members of the group at the formation time,
section 705-57 (about loss of pre-CGT status of certain
*membership interests) only applies if the *membership interests
held directly by the *head company of the group are affected.
Modified application of section 705-57—basic modification
(2) For the purposes of applying section 705-57 in accordance with
this Subdivision, a reference in that section to a *membership
interest that a *member of the joined group holds in the joining
entity at the joining time is taken to be a reference to a
*membership interest that the *head company of the *consolidated
group holds directly in an entity becoming a *subsidiary member at
the formation time.
Modified application of section 705-57—additional modifications
where section 705-145 applies
(3) Also, if an entity (the first entity) that becomes a *subsidiary
member holds a *membership interest (the subject membership
interest) in another entity (the second entity) that becomes a
subsidiary member, section 705-57 (as modified in accordance
with subsection (2)) is to be applied in relation to the subject
membership interest as follows.
(4) First work out whether there would be a reduction under that
section in the *tax cost setting amount for the subject membership
interest that is used as mentioned in subsection 705-145(3) (the
subsection 705-145(3) tax cost setting amount) if:
(a) the subject membership interest, if it is not a revenue etc.
asset of the first entity, were taken to be such an asset; and

(b) paragraphs 705-57(2)(c) and (d) and subsection 705-57(7)
did not apply to the subject membership interest.
(5) Next, if there would be such a reduction (whose amount is the
notional section 705-57 reduction amount):
(a) apply section 705-57 to reduce the *tax cost setting amount
for any revenue etc. asset of the second entity; and
(b) if the second entity holds a *membership interest in another
entity that becomes a *subsidiary member—apply
section 705-57 in relation to that interest in accordance with
subsection (3) of this section;
and for those purposes:
(c) the subject membership interest is taken to be a membership
interest that the *head company of the group holds directly in
the second entity at the formation time; and
(d) the requirements of paragraphs 705-57(2)(a) and (b) are
taken to be satisfied in relation to the subject membership
interest; and
(e) the subject membership interest is taken to have a *cost base
and *reduced cost base equal to the subsection 705-145(3) tax
cost setting amount; and
(f) the subject membership interest is taken to have a loss of
pre-CGT status adjustment amount equal to the notional
section 705-57 reduction amount.
Note:

If the head company actually held any membership interests in the
second entity, or if other entities becoming subsidiary members held
membership interests in the second entity to which this subsection also
applied, those membership interests would also be taken into account
in working out the reduction under paragraph (a) and in applying
paragraph (b).

Section 705-57 not to apply where membership interests effectively
acquired on normal market basis

(a) apart from this subsection, subsection 705-57(6) would apply

Application
(1) This Subdivision applies if all of the *members of a *consolidated
group (the acquired group) become members of another
consolidated group (the acquiring group) at a particular time (the
acquisition time) as a result of the *acquisition of *membership
interests in the *head company of the acquired group.
Object
(2) The object of this Subdivision is:
(a) to modify the rules in Division 701 (the core rules) to
complement the treatment of the acquired group as a single
entity that applied before the acquisition time; and
(b) to modify Subdivision 705-A (which basically determines the
tax cost setting amount for assets of an entity joining a
consolidated group) to ensure that the *tax cost setting
amount for assets of the acquired group that become those of
the acquiring group reflects the cost to the latter group of

705-185 Subdivision 705-A has effect with modifications
(1) Subdivision 705-A has effect in relation to the acquiring group for
the head company core purposes set out in subsection 701-1(2) as
if:
(a) the only *member of the acquired group that is a joining
entity of the acquiring group were the entity that, just before
the acquisition time, was the *head company of the acquired
group; and
(b) the operation of this Part for the head company core purposes
in relation to the head company and the entities that were
*subsidiary members of the acquired group continued to have
effect for the purposes of Subdivision 705-A.
Note 1:

This means that for Subdivision 705-A purposes the subsidiary
members of the acquired group are treated as part of the head
company of that group, and as a result their assets (other than e.g.
internal membership interests) have their tax costs set at the
acquisition time.

Note 2:

It also means e.g. that for Subdivision 705-A purposes the terminating
values of the assets of those subsidiary members are worked out as if
the assets were those of the head company at the acquisition time, and
hence will be based (if applicable) on the tax cost setting amounts for
assets that were set at the time entities became subsidiary members of
the acquired group.

(2) However, that effect of Subdivision 705-A is subject to
modifications set out in this Subdivision.
Note:

The modifications of Subdivision 705-A made in this Subdivision
constitute the second exception to Subdivision 705-A: see

joining time, membership interests in all of the other entities.

Example: Entities A and B are not members of a consolidated group, but
members of such a group, together with entity A, jointly hold all the
membership interests in entity B. Members of the group then acquire

setting amount
(3) The *tax cost setting amount worked out for assets of a linked
entity mentioned in subsection (2) consisting of *membership
interests in another such entity is to be used as the amount for those
interests under subsection 705-65(1) (step 1 of allocable cost
amount) in working out the tax cost setting amount for assets of
that other linked entity.
Note 1:

Subsection 705-65(1) adds together amounts worked out in
accordance with section 705-65 representing the cost of the
membership interests that each member of the group holds in the
linked entity. If any of those membership interests is held by another
linked entity, subsection (3) of this section will replace the amount
otherwise applicable with the tax cost setting amount that will have
been worked out for the interests in accordance with subsection (2) of
this section.

Note 2:

The tax cost setting amount worked out for the membership interests
has no relevance other than for the purpose mentioned in
subsection (3) of this subsection. This is because, under the single
entity principle, intra group membership interests are ignored while
entities are members of the group. If an entity ceases to be a member,
section 701-15 and Division 711 set the tax cost of membership
interests in the entity at that time.

means the *market value, at the linked entity joining time, of
all *membership interests in the subject entity that are held by
entities that become *members of the group at that time.
market value of first level entity’s direct and indirect
membership interests in subject entity means so much of the
*market value of all membership interests in the subject
entity (as defined above) as is attributable to *membership
interests that the first level entity holds directly, or indirectly
through other linked entities; and
(d) the subject entity has the remainder of the step 3A amount.
Membership interests in subsidiary members of group
(3) In applying section 705-93 for the purposes of this Subdivision,
disregard paragraph 705-93(1)(f) if:
(a) the rollover asset mentioned in that section is a *membership
interest in an entity that becomes a *subsidiary member at the
linked entity joining time; and
(b) the rollover asset is not held at that time by the entity that
becomes the *head company of the group.
Note:

The step 3A amount is worked out under section 705-93.

(1) The object of this section is to ensure that, in working out the
group’s *allocable cost amount for the linked entities, the reduction
under step 4 in the table in section 705-60 (about pre-formation
time distributions out of certain profits) is made only for profits

(2) This section applies to a distribution to the extent that the
following conditions are satisfied:
(a) the distribution is made by a linked entity;
(b) in working out the group’s *allocable cost amount for the
linked entity there would, apart from this section, be a

Modified application of section 705-57—basic modification
(2) For the purposes of applying section 705-57 in accordance with
this Subdivision, a reference in that section to a *membership
interest that a *member of the joined group holds in the joining
entity at the joining time is taken to be a reference to a membership
interest that the *head company of the *consolidated group holds
directly in a linked entity at the time the linked entity becomes a

interest (the subject membership interest) in another linked entity
(the second linked entity), section 705-57 (as modified in
accordance with subsection (2)) is to be applied in relation to the
subject membership interest as follows.
(4) First work out whether there would be a reduction under that
section in the *tax cost setting amount for the subject membership
interest that is used as mentioned in subsection 705-225(3) (the
subsection 705-225(3) tax cost setting amount) if:

asset of the first linked entity, were taken to be such an asset;
and

(5) Next, if there would be such a reduction (whose amount is the
notional section 705-57 reduction amount):
(a) apply section 705-57 to reduce the *tax cost setting amount
for any revenue etc. asset of the second linked entity; and

(3) The second condition is that:
(a) the *head company made one or more errors in working out

705-320 Tax cost setting amounts taken to be correct
(1) For the purposes of this Act (other than this Subdivision) and for
the purposes of the Taxation Administration Act 1953, any *tax
cost setting amounts that were worked out by the *head company,
so far as they were due to the errors, are taken to have been correct

Note 2:

Subsection (1) means that the Commissioner cannot amend any
assessments necessary to correct the errors, and that (except as
mentioned in subsection (2)) no offences or administrative penalties
arise in respect of the errors.

(2) Subsection (1) does not apply for the purposes of determining
whether there is an offence against section 8N of the Taxation

Objects
707-110 Objects of this Subdivision
The main objects of this Subdivision are:
(a) to provide for the transfer of a loss from an entity (the
joining entity) becoming a *member of a *consolidated group
to the *head company of the group (so the head company
may be able to *utilise it), if the joining entity could have
utilised the loss if it had not become a member of the group;
and
(b) to prevent the utilisation by any entity of a loss made by the
joining entity, if the joining entity could not have utilised the
loss if it had not become a member of the group.

Application
707-115 What losses this Subdivision applies to
This Subdivision applies to a loss of any *sort if:
(a) an entity (the joining entity) becomes a *member of a
*consolidated group (the joined group) at a time (the joining
time) in an income year (the joining year); and
(b) the loss was made by the joining entity for an income year
ending before the joining time.
Note 1:

If the joining entity had a loss transferred to it by a previous operation
of this Subdivision (when the entity was the head company of a
consolidated group), this Subdivision operates later as if the joining
entity had made the loss. See section 707-140.

Note 2:

Section 707-405 may affect the income year for which the joining
entity is treated as having made the loss, if the joining entity made the
loss and the loss is referable to part of an income year.

Transfer of loss from joining entity to head company
707-120 Transfer of loss from joining entity to head company
Transfer of loss from joining entity to head company
(1) Subject to subsection (1A), the loss is transferred at the joining
time from the joining entity to the *head company of the joined
group (even if they are the same entity).
(1A) The loss is transferred under subsection (1) only to the extent (if
any) that the loss could have been *utilised by the joining entity for
an income year consisting of the *trial year if:
(a) at the joining time, the joining entity had not become a
*member of the joined group (but had been a *wholly-owned
subsidiary of the *head company if the joining entity is not
the head company); and
(b) the amount of the loss that could be utilised for the trial year
were not limited by the joining entity’s income or gains for
the trial year.
What is the trial year?
(2) The trial year is the period:
(a) starting at the latest of these times:
(i) the time 12 months before the joining time;
(ii) the time the joining entity came into existence;
(iii) the time the joining entity last ceased to be a *subsidiary
member of a *consolidated group, if the joining entity
had been a member of a consolidated group before the
joining time but was not a *member of a consolidated
group just before the joining time; and
(b) ending just after the joining time.

Business continuity test involving trial year
(3) When working out whether the joining entity carried on,
throughout the *trial year (or a period including the trial year):
(a) the same business as the business it carried on at a particular
time; or
(b) a similar business to the business it carried on at that time;
assume that the entity carried on at and just after the joining time
the same business that it carried on just before the joining time.
Transfer of loss for income year overlapping trial year
(4) If the loss was made by the joining entity for an income year all or
part of which occurs in the *trial year, the transfer of the loss under
subsection (1) is not prevented by the fact that the loss was made
for that income year.
Designated infrastructure project entities
(5) Despite subsection (1A), the loss is transferred under
subsection (1) to the full extent if:
(a) the loss is a *tax loss; and
(b) the joining entity is a *designated infrastructure project
entity:
(i) at a time in the *loss year; and
(ii) just before the joining time.

707-125 Modified business continuity test for companies’ post-1999
losses
(1) This section operates if:
(a) the joining entity made the loss for an income year starting
after 30 June 1999; and
(b) section 165-13 or subsection 165-15(2) or (3) or 166-5(5) or
(6) is relevant to working out (under section 707-120)
whether the loss is transferred from the joining entity.

(2) Work out whether the loss is transferred on the basis that
section 165-13 required the joining entity to satisfy the *business
continuity test for:
(a) the period (the business continuity test period) consisting of:
(i) the *trial year; and
(ii) the income year that included the *test time worked out
for section 165-13 for the joining entity (disregarding
paragraph (b) of this subsection), if that income year
started before the trial year; and
(b) the time (the test time) just before the end of the income year
for which the loss was made by the joining entity.
(3) Work out whether the loss is transferred on the basis that:
(a) subsection 165-15(2) specified that the period (the business
continuity test period) for the *business continuity test
consisted of:
(i) the *trial year; and
(ii) the income year in which the person began to control, or
became able to control, the voting power in the
company, if that income year started before the trial
year; and
(b) subsection 165-15(3) required the business continuity test to
be applied to the company’s business immediately before the
time (the test time) just before the end of the income year for
which the loss was made by the joining entity.
(4) If Subdivision 166-A would apply to the joining entity for an
income year consisting of the *trial year, work out whether the loss
is transferred on the basis that:
(a) subsection 166-5(5) treated the joining entity as having
satisfied the condition in section 165-13 if the joining entity
satisfied the *business continuity test for the period (the
business continuity test period) consisting of:

be applied to the *business that the joining entity carried on at
the time (the test time) just before the end of the income year
for which the loss was made by the joining entity.
Note:

Subdivision 166-A applies to widely held companies and eligible
Division 166 companies unless they choose that Subdivision 165-A
apply to them without the modifications made by Subdivision 166-A.

(5) For the purposes of subparagraph (4)(a)(ii), the income year is:
(a) the income year in which occurred the first time mentioned in
subsection 166-5(6); or
(b) the income year of the joining entity containing the time at
which the joining entity is taken under subsection 707-210(5)
to fail to meet the condition in section 165-12, if that
subsection is relevant to working out whether the joining
entity can *utilise the loss.
Note 1:

Section 707-205 affects the start of the test period if the joining entity
made the loss under a previous operation of this Subdivision.

Note 2:

Section 707-210 is about whether a company can utilise certain losses
transferred to it under this Subdivision from a company.

(6) Subsection (4) of this section has effect despite
subsection 707-210(6).
Note:

Subsection 707-210(6) modifies section 166-5 for working out
whether a company can utilise certain losses transferred to it under
this Subdivision from a company.

707-130 Modified pattern of distributions test
(1) This section operates for the purpose of working out (under
section 707-120) whether the loss is transferred from the joining
entity, if section 267-20 in Schedule 2F to the Income Tax
Assessment Act 1936 is relevant for that purpose.

entity made the loss until the time it became a subsidiary member of
the joined group (and was not an excepted trust at all times in the
period).
Note 2:

That section prevents an entity from utilising a tax loss unless the
entity meets the conditions in subsection 267-30(2) (if applicable) and
section 267-35 in that Schedule by passing the pattern of distributions
test for certain income years.

(2) Section 267-30 in that Schedule has effect as if the income year
mentioned in that section were the joining year, and not the *trial
year.
Note:

Section 267-30 in that Schedule requires the joining entity to pass the
pattern of distributions test for the income year mentioned in that
section if that entity distributed income or capital in that income year
or within 2 months after the end of that income year.

(3) Section 267-35 in that Schedule has effect as if the reference in that
section to an earlier income year were to an income year earlier
than the joining year.
(4) Disregard each distribution (if any) of income or capital (within the
meaning of that Schedule) made by the joining entity after the
joining time, so far as it was made from an amount of the entity’s
income or capital attributable to a time after the joining time, in
working out:
(a) whether section 267-30 in that Schedule requires the joining
entity to pass the pattern of distributions test (as defined in
that Schedule); and
(b) whether the joining entity passes that test as required by
section 267-30 or 267-35 in that Schedule.
Note:

Disregarding that percentage of a distribution may affect a test year
distribution of income or a test year distribution of capital, as those
terms are defined in section 269-65 in that Schedule, and thus affect
whether the joining entity passes the pattern of distributions test under
section 269-60 in that Schedule.

Section 707-135
707-135 Transferring loss transferred to joining entity because
business continuity test was satisfied
(1) This section operates if the loss had been transferred to the joining
entity (by a previous operation of this Subdivision) because the
entity from which the loss was transferred carried on during a
particular period:
(a) the same business as it carried on at a particular time; or
(b) if section 165-211 applies in relation to the loss—a business
similar to the business it carried on at a particular time.
Note:

Section 165-211 enables an entity to satisfy the business continuity
test by carrying on a similar business.

(2) The loss is not transferred from the joining entity to the *head
company of the joined group (despite section 707-120), unless the
joining entity satisfies the *business continuity test for:
(a) the *trial year (the business continuity test period); and
(b) the time (the test time) just before the end of the income year
in which the loss was transferred to the joining entity.

Effect of transfer of loss
707-140 Effect of transfer of loss
(1) To the extent that the loss is transferred under section 707-120
from the joining entity to the *head company of the joined group,
this Act operates (except so far as the contrary intention appears)
for the purposes of income years ending after the transfer as if:
(a) the head company had made the loss for the income year in
which the transfer occurs; and
(b) the joining entity had not made the loss for the income year
for which the joining entity actually made the loss.
(1A) However, subsection (1) does not affect the operation of
paragraph 165-211(1)(a) or (c).

Section 707-145
Note:

This subsection ensures that the head company can only apply the
version of the business continuity test in section 165-211 if the loss of
the joining entity was incurred on or after 1 July 2015.

Head company may utilise loss for income year of transfer
(2) The *head company is not prevented from *utilising the loss for the
income year in which the transfer occurs merely because this Act
operates as if the head company had made the loss (to the extent of
the transfer) for that year.
Debt forgiveness in income year for which loss is made
(3) If a debt of the *head company of the joined group is *forgiven in
the income year in which the transfer occurs, sections 245-115 and
245-130 operate as if the head company had made the loss for an
earlier income year.
Note:

This subsection has the effect that the loss may be reduced in
accordance with one of those subsections by applying the total net
forgiven amount for the income year in which the transfer occurs.

Cancelling the transfer of the loss
707-145 Cancelling the transfer of the loss
(1) The *head company of the joined group may choose to cancel the
transfer of the loss.
(2) If the *head company of the joined group does so, this Act (except
this section) operates for all income years ending after the transfer
as if it had not occurred under section 707-120.
(3) The choice cannot be revoked.

Section 707-210
(2) Subdivision 165-A and Divisions 166 and 167 operate for those
purposes as if the *loss year started at the time of the transfer.
Note 1:

This means that the ownership test period defined by
subsection 165-12(1) and the test period defined by
subsection 166-5(2) start at the time of the transfer.

Note 2:

Without this section, those periods would start at the start of the
income year in which the transfer occurred, so events occurring before
the transfer (such as changes in holdings of voting power, rights to
dividends or rights to capital) could affect whether the company could
utilise the tax loss or net capital loss.

707-210 Utilisation of certain losses transferred from a company
depends on company that made the losses earlier
(1) This section has effect for the purposes of working out whether a
company (the latest transferee) can *utilise for an income year a
loss it made because of a *COT transfer from a company (the latest
transferor).
(1A) A transfer of a loss under Subdivision 707-A from a company to a
company is a COT transfer of the loss if the transfer occurs
because:
(a) the transferor meets the conditions in section 165-12; and
(b) the conditions in one or more of paragraphs 165-15(1)(a), (b)
and (c) do not exist in relation to the transferor.
Meeting conditions in section 165-12
(2) The latest transferee is taken to meet the conditions in
section 165-12 for the income year in relation to the loss if and
only if the company (the test company) described in subsection (3)
would have met those conditions for the income year had the
circumstances described in subsection (4) existed.
Note 1:

The latest transferee and the test company may be the same company.

Note 2:

Section 707-405 may affect the income year for which the test
company is treated as having made the loss, if the loss is referable to
part of an income year.

(3) The test company is the first company to make the loss. However,
if:
(a) the loss was made by the latest transferor because of one or
more earlier transfers of the loss under Subdivision 707-A
from a company to a company; and
(b) one or more of those earlier transfers was not a *COT
transfer;
the test company is the company to which the loss was transferred
in the most recent transfer described in paragraph (b).
(4) The circumstances are that:
(a) the test company was not treated by Subdivision 707-A for
the income year as not having made the loss; and
(b) if the test company made the loss apart from that Subdivision
and transferred the loss to itself under that Subdivision—the
test company was not treated by that Subdivision for the
income year as having made the loss for the income year in
which the transfer occurred; and
(c) nothing happened, after the time the loss was transferred
from the test company to the *head company of a
*consolidated group, to *membership interests or voting
power:
(i) in an entity that was at that time a *subsidiary member
of the group; or
(ii) in an entity that was at that time interposed between the
test company and the head company;
that would affect whether the test company would meet the
conditions in section 165-12 for the income year; and
(d) if the loss has later been transferred under that Subdivision to
the head company of another consolidated group—nothing
happened, after the time of the later transfer, to membership
interests or voting power:
(i) in the later transferor; or
(ii) in an entity that was at that time interposed between the

Section 707-305

Object
707-305 Object of this Subdivision
(1) The main object of this Subdivision is to limit, in a way that gives
effect to the principles in subsections (2) and (3), the amount of
losses transferred under Subdivision 707-A that can be *utilised for
an income year by the transferee.
(2) One principle is that the transferee is to *utilise the transferred
losses for an income year only to the extent to which it has income
or gains for the income year remaining after reduction by its other
losses and deductions.
(3) The other principle is that the amount of a transferred loss that the
transferee can *utilise is to reflect the amount of the loss that the
transferor could have *utilised for the income year if the transferor
of the loss (whether the original maker of the loss or not) had not
become a *member of a *consolidated group at the time of the
transfer.
(4) To give effect to those principles, this Subdivision operates on the
assumption that, if each transferor of a loss to the transferee had
not become a *member of a *consolidated group at the time of the
transfer:
(a) all the transferors of transferred losses to the transferee
would have made income or gains for the year whose total
did not exceed the transferee’s income or gains for the year
remaining after reduction by its other losses and deductions;
and
(b) a particular transferor’s income or gains for the year would
have equalled a fraction of the transferee’s income or gains
for the year remaining after reduction by its other losses and
deductions.
(5) The fraction is worked out by reference to the transferor’s *market
value at the time of the transfer (on the assumption that market
value reflects capacity to generate income or gains in future).

How much of a transferred loss can be utilised?
707-310 How much of a transferred loss can be utilised?
(1) This section limits the amount of losses in a particular *bundle of
losses transferred under Subdivision 707-A that can be *utilised by
the transferee. The limit is set by reference to the *available
fraction for the bundle.
Note:

Section 707-335 of this Act and section 707-350 of the Income Tax
(Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 set different limits on utilising
losses in a bundle of losses in certain circumstances.

Basic rule
(2) The transferee cannot *utilise more of the losses in the *bundle than
the transferee would have been able to utilise (apart from this
section) under the conditions in subsections (3), (4) and (5).
(3) The first condition is that the only amount of the transferee’s
*ordinary income, *statutory income or gains (if any) of a kind
described in column 1 of an item of the table for the income year is
the *available fraction of the amount worked out as described in
column 2 of the item having regard to:
(a) the transferee’s *ordinary income, *statutory income or gains
for the income year apart from this section; and
(b) the transferee’s deductions for the income year and losses,
except losses transferred to the transferee under
Subdivision 707-A.

Section 707-310
(a) the transferee’s *tax losses to which paragraph (b) of, or the
table in, that subsection applies are to be worked out on the
assumption that the transferee chooses to deduct under
subsection 36-17(2) all of the tax losses and that
subsection 36-17(5) does not apply to that choice; and
(b) except as mentioned in paragraph (a) of this subsection,
amounts worked out as described in column 2 of an item of
the table in subsection (3) are to be worked out making the
same choices as the transferee actually makes in working out
its taxable income as stated in its *income tax return for the
income year; and
(c) the transferee’s grossed-up franking offset amount mentioned
in column 2 of item 6 in the table is the amount worked out
using the formula:
1
 Franking offsets
Transferee’s *corporate tax rate for imputation purposes
for the income year

where:
franking offsets means the total amount of *tax offsets to
which the transferee is entitled for the income year under
Division 207 and Subdivision 210-H (except those that are
subject to the refundable tax offset rules because of
section 67-25).
(4) The second condition is that once the amounts of the transferee’s
income or gains have been worked out under subsection (3) they
are not reduced by:
(a) deductions, or losses, other than losses in the *bundle; or
(b) taxes or expenses described in subsection 375-805(4) (which
is about *net exempt film income).
Note:

One of the effects of subsection (4) is that, for working out how much
of a film loss in the bundle can be deducted from the transferee’s net
exempt film income or net assessable film income:
(a) the transferee’s net exempt film income will be the same as its
exempt film income worked out under subsection (3); and

(b) the transferee’s net assessable film income will be the same as its
assessable film income worked out under subsection (3).

(5) The third condition is that once the amounts of the transferee’s
*exempt income have been worked out under subsection (3),
assume that the transferee had no losses, outgoings or taxes
described in subsection 36-20(1) (which is about *net exempt
income), in working out how much of a *tax loss in the *bundle can
be deducted from the transferee’s net exempt income.

707-315 What is a bundle of losses?
(1) A bundle of losses comes into existence at the time (the initial
transfer time) a loss of any *sort that has not previously been
transferred under Subdivision 707-A is transferred under that
Subdivision from an entity (the real loss-maker) to the *head
company of a *consolidated group (the joined group).
(2) At the initial transfer time, the bundle consists of every loss
(regardless of its *sort) that:
(a) is transferred at that time under that Subdivision from the real
loss-maker to the *head company of the joined group; and
(b) has not been transferred under that Subdivision before that
time.
Note:

For certain purposes, section 707-327 of the Income Tax (Transitional
Provisions) Act 1997 treats the bundle as including certain other losses
too.

(3) The bundle still exists at a later time if it includes at that later time
at least one loss of any *sort that could be *utilised or otherwise
reduced by an entity for an income year ending after that time
(even if one or more losses have ceased to be included in the
bundle before that later time).
Note:

A bundle continues to exist even if the losses in it are transferred
again under Subdivision 707-A after the initial transfer time.

(4) A loss ceases to be included in a *bundle at the first time for which
it is true that the loss cannot be *utilised or otherwise reduced by
any entity for an income year ending after that time.

Section 707-320
(5) If, had a loss been made by a company as assumed under a
provision of Division 170, the loss would have been transferred
under Subdivision 707-A, this Subdivision and other provisions
that relate to or may affect the *available fractions for one or more
*bundles of losses (including sections 707-140 and 719-325)
operate as if the transfer had occurred.
Note:

Section 707-140 provides for a choice to cancel a transfer under
Subdivision 707-A. Section 719-325 provides for a choice to cancel
all losses in certain bundles of losses. A choice under one of those
sections may result in a bundle not coming into existence, or not being
in existence after a certain time.

(6) To avoid doubt, a choice under section 707-145 or 719-325, as it
operates because of subsection (5) of this section, relating to the
loss does not affect or prevent:
(a) a transfer of the loss that would have occurred under
Subdivision 707-A as described in another application of that
subsection involving a different company; or
(b) *utilisation of the loss by the company that actually made the
loss and is different from the company assumed under
Division 170 to have made the loss.
Note:

Therefore a choice under section 707-145 or 719-325, as operating
because of subsection (5) of this section, will be able to cause only
one bundle not to exist, and will not affect the existence of other
bundles that are treated as existing because of other operations of that
subsection.

707-320 What is the available fraction for a bundle of losses?
(1) The available fraction for a *bundle of losses at a time is:
*Modified market value of the real loss-maker at the initial transfer time
Transferee’s adjusted market value at the initial transfer time

where:
transferee’s adjusted market value at the initial transfer time
means the amount that would be the *market value, at the initial

were transferred at that time if:
(a) the transferee did not have a loss of any *sort for an income
year ending before that time; and
(b) the balance of the transferee’s *franking account were nil at
that time.
Note:

The value for the transferee will be worked out on the basis that
subsidiary members of the consolidated group headed by the
transferee are part of the transferee, because of section 701-1 (the
single entity rule).

(b) take account of the results of a calculation under an earlier
item in making a calculation under a later item.
(4) For a *bundle of losses:
(a) subject to paragraph (b)—the available fraction is worked
out to 3 decimal places, rounding up if the fourth decimal
place is 5 or more; or
(b) if the available fraction worked out under paragraph (a) is
0.000 and, if it were worked out to more decimal places, it
would include one or more non-zero digits—the available
fraction is worked out to the number of decimal places that
includes the first or only such digit, rounding up if the next
decimal place is 5 or more.
Examples: For 0.000328, the available fraction is 0.0003. For 0.000086,
the available fraction is 0.00009.

(4A) Subsections (1) and (2) have effect subject to subsection (4).
(5) If, apart from this subsection, the available fraction for a *bundle

707-325 Modified market value of an entity becoming a member of a
consolidated group
Basic rule
(1) The modified market value of an entity that becomes a *member of
a *consolidated group at a particular time is the amount that would
be the *market value of the entity at that time if:
(a) the entity had no loss of any *sort for any income year, and
the balance of its *franking account at that time were nil; and
(b) the *subsidiary members of the group at that time were
separate entities and not just parts of the *head company of
the group; and
(c) the entity’s market value did not include an amount
attributable (directly or indirectly) to a *membership interest
in a member of the group (other than the entity):
(i) that is a *corporate tax entity; or
(ii) that transferred a loss under Subdivision 707-A to the
head company of the group at or before that time; and
(d) the contribution to the entity’s market value made by a trust
(other than one that is a member described in paragraph (c))
were limited to the amount attributable to the entity’s *fixed
entitlements (if any) at that time to income or capital of the
trust that is not attributable (directly or indirectly) to a
membership interest in such a member.
Note 1:

Section 707-330 affects the modified market value of an entity that
becomes a subsidiary member of the consolidated group, if the entity
was the head company of another consolidated group just beforehand.

certain circumstances for the purposes of working out the available
fraction for a bundle of losses transferred from the entity.

Rule to prevent inflation of modified market value
(2) However, if:
(a) one or more of the events described in subsection (4)
occurred in the 4 years before the time; and
(b) the amount worked out under subsection (1) exceeds what it
would have been if none of those events had occurred;
the modified market value of the entity at the time is the amount
worked out under subsection (1), reduced by the amount worked
out under subsection (3).
(3) The amount of the reduction is the lesser of:
(a) the excess described in paragraph (2)(b); and
(b) the total increase in the *market value of the entity that
occurred immediately after each event mentioned in
paragraph (2)(a) because of the event.
(4) These are the events:
(a) an injection of capital into the entity or an entity that was an
*associate of the entity (or of the trustee of the entity, if the
entity is a trust) at the time of the injection;
(b) a transaction that:
(i) did not take place at *arm’s length; and
(ii) involved the entity or an entity that was an associate of
the entity (or of the trustee of the entity, if the entity is a
trust) at the time of the transaction.
(5) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), disregard an injection of
capital if, and only if, it is made:
(a) into a *listed public company through a *dividend
reinvestment *scheme involving the issue of a *share in the
company to an entity that held a share in the company before
the injection; or

during the income year, at the time of the transfer; and
(b) ends when one of these events occurs:
(i) the income year ends;
(ii) the transferee becomes a *subsidiary member of a

(3) The transferee cannot *utilise for the income year more of the
losses than is reasonable having regard to:

Section 709-60

Treatment of franking accounts at joining time
709-60 Nil balance franking account for joining entity
(1) This section operates if an entity (the joining entity) becomes a
*subsidiary member of a *consolidated group at a time (the joining
time).
(2) If the joining entity’s *franking account is in surplus just before the
joining time:
(a) a debit equal to the *franking surplus arises at the joining
time in the joining entity’s franking account; and
(b) a credit equal to the franking surplus arises at the joining
time in the franking account of the *head company of the
group.
(3) If the joining entity’s *franking account is in deficit just before the
joining time:
(a) a credit equal to the *franking deficit arises at the joining
time in the joining entity’s franking account; and
(b) the joining entity is liable to pay *franking deficit tax as if the
joining entity’s income year had ended just before the joining
time; and
(c) despite item 5 of the table in section 205-15, a credit does not
arise under that item in the joining entity’s franking account
because of that liability.

Treatment of subsidiary member’s franking account
709-65 Subsidiary member’s franking account does not operate
The *franking account of an entity that is a *subsidiary member of
a *consolidated group does not operate during the period:
(a) beginning just after the entity becomes a subsidiary member
of the group; and
(b) ending when the entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of
the group.

the group at the crediting time.
Note:

A credit can also arise in the head company’s franking account at any

that would arise in the *franking account of the *subsidiary
member.
(4) This section does not apply to a credit arising in the *subsidiary
member’s *franking account under paragraph 709-60(3)(a).
Note:

Such a credit arises if the entity that became the subsidiary member
had a deficit in its franking account just before the time it became the
subsidiary member. The credit equals the deficit, creating a nil balance
in the account from that time.

709-75 Debits arising in head company’s franking account

of a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated group at a time (the
debiting time) apart from section 709-65.
(2) A debit arises in the *franking account of the *head company of the
group at the debiting time.
Note:

A debit can also arise in the head company’s franking account at any
time under section 205-30.

certain preference shares taken to be distributions by the
head company
(1) This section operates if:

Section 709-185
709-185 Joining entity’s excess franking deficit tax offsets
transferred to head company
(1) This section operates if:
(a) an entity (the joining entity) becomes a *subsidiary member
of a *consolidated group at a time (the joining time); and
(b) the joining entity is entitled to a *tax offset under
section 205-70 for the income year that ends or, if
subsection 701-30(3) applies, that is taken by subsection (3)
of that section to end, at the joining time; and
(c) an amount (the joining entity’s excess) of the offset remains
after applying section 63-10 (about the tax offset priority
rules) to the joining entity’s basic income tax liability for that
income year.
Transfer of excess to head company
(2) For the purpose of applying subsection 205-70(1) to the *head
company of the *consolidated group for the income year in which
the joining time occurs:
(a) if, as described in paragraph 205-70(1)(c), an amount of a
*tax offset remains after applying section 63-10—that
amount is taken to be increased by the amount of the joining
entity’s excess; or
(b) otherwise:
(i) paragraph 205-70(1)(c) is taken to apply to the head
company; and
(ii) the remaining amount of a tax offset covered by that
paragraph is taken to be the amount of the joining
entity’s excess.
Note:

Paragraph 205-70(1)(c) refers to tax offsets under section 205-70.

(2A) In working out whether paragraph (2)(a) applies, take into account
any application of this section to any other entity that became a
*subsidiary member of the group before the joining time.

Application and object
709-205 Application of this Subdivision
(1) This Subdivision affects whether an entity (the claimant) that is or
has been a *member of a *consolidated group and writes off a debt,
or part of a debt, as bad may deduct the debt or part if the
conditions in subsection (2) exist.
Note:

This Subdivision affects similarly whether an entity that is or has been
a member of a consolidated group and extinguishes a debt as part of a
debt/equity swap may deduct a loss resulting from the swap. See
section 709-220.

(2) The conditions are that, in the time starting when the debt was
incurred (whether to the claimant or another entity) and ending
when the claimant wrote off the debt or part:
(a) the debt was owed to an entity (whether the claimant or
another entity) for a period (a debt test period) when the
entity was a *member of a *consolidated group; and

Section 709-210
(b) the debt was owed to an entity (whether the claimant or
another entity) for a period (also a debt test period) when the
entity was a not a member of that group.
Note 1:

The debt must have been owed to the claimant for at least one of the
debt test periods for the claimant to have been able to write it off.

Note 2:

One effect of section 701-1 (Single entity rule) is that a debt is taken
to be owed to the head company of a consolidated group while the
debt is owed to a subsidiary member of the group.

(3) Ignore section 701-5 (Entry history rule) and section 701-40 (Exit
history rule) in identifying a debt test period.
Note:

Subsection (3) does not affect sections 701-5 and 701-40 so far as they
operate to treat the debt, or part of the debt, as having been included in
the claimant’s assessable income. That inclusion is generally a
condition under section 25-35 for the claimant to be able to deduct the
debt.

(4) This Subdivision does not apply in relation to a debt merely
because it is assigned:
(a) from an entity that is a *member of a *consolidated group to
an entity that is not a member of that group; or
(b) from an entity that is not a member of a consolidated group
to an entity that is a member of a consolidated group; or
(c) from an entity that is a member of a consolidated group to an
entity that is a member of another consolidated group.
This subsection has effect despite subsections (1) and (2).
Note:

There is not an assignment of a debt from one entity to another merely
because section 701-1 (Single entity rule) starts or ceases to apply in
relation to the entities so that the debt ceases to be a debt owed to one
entity and becomes a debt owed to the other entity.

709-210 Object of this Subdivision
The main object of this Subdivision is to ensure that the claimant
can deduct the debt, or part of it, only if each entity that was owed
the debt for a debt test period could have deducted the debt if it had
been written off as bad at the end of the period.

Application and object of this Division
711-5 Application and object of this Division
Application
(1) This Division has effect:
(a) for the head company core purposes set out in
subsection 701-1(2); and
(b) for the entity core purposes set out in subsection 701-1(3);
if an entity (the leaving entity) ceases to be a *subsidiary member
of a *consolidated group (the old group) at a particular time (the
leaving time).
Object
(2) The object of this Division is, when entities cease to be *subsidiary
members, to preserve the alignment of the *head company’s costs
for *membership interests in entities and their assets that is
established when entities become subsidiary members.
Note:

The reasons for preserving this alignment are set out in
subsection 705-10(3).

(3) This is achieved by recognising the *head company’s cost for those
interests, just before the leaving time, as an amount equal to the
cost of the leaving entity’s assets at the leaving time reduced by the
amount of its liabilities.
(4) If multiple entities cease to be *subsidiary members at the same
time, the cost of any *membership interests that one holds in
another is treated in a similar way.

Section 711-10

Tax cost setting amount for membership interests etc.
711-10 Tax cost setting amount worked out under this Division
If this Division applies, the amount of the following is worked out
under the Division:
(a) the *tax cost setting amount for the purposes of item 2 in the
table in section 701-60 for each *membership interest in the
leaving entity that *members of the old group held; and
(b) if 2 or more entities cease to be *subsidiary members of the
group at the same time because of an event happening in
relation to one of them—the tax cost setting amount for the
purposes of item 4 in the table in that section for each
membership interest that the leaving entity holds in any of
the other entities.

711-15 Tax cost setting amount where no multiple exit
(1) The *tax cost setting amount for each *membership interest in the
leaving entity that *members of the old group held, where
paragraph 711-10(b) does not apply, is worked out by:
(a) first, working out the old group’s *allocable cost amount for
the leaving entity in accordance with section 711-20; and
(b) next, if there is more than one class of membership interests
in the leaving entity—allocating the allocable cost amount to
each class in proportion to the *market value of all of the
membership interests in the class; and
(c) next, allocating the result under paragraph (a) or (b) to each
of the membership interests, or membership interests in the
class, by dividing the result by the number of those
membership interests; and
(d) finally, if the leaving entity is a trust—for each membership
interest in the trust that satisfies these conditions:
(i) it is neither a unit nor an interest in the trust;
(ii) the member of the old group that held it began to hold it
only because money or property was settled on the trust;

reducing the result under paragraph (c) to nil.
Note:

Compare the treatment of such interests when an entity joins a
group: see section 713-20.

Non-membership equity interests
(2) For the purposes of this section, if at the leaving time a *member of
the old group holds a *non-membership equity interest in the
leaving entity, that non-membership equity interest is treated as if:
(a) it were a *membership interest in the leaving entity; and
(b) it were of a different class than any other membership
interest in the leaving entity.

Working out the old group’s allocable cost amount for the leaving entity
Step

What the step requires

Purpose of the step

1

Start with the step 1 amount worked
out under section 711-25, which is
about the *terminating values of the
leaving entity’s assets just before the
leaving time.

To ensure that the allocable cost
amount includes the cost of the
assets.

2

Add to the result of step 1 the step 2
amount worked out under
section 711-35, which is about the
value of deductions inherited by the
leaving entity that are not reflected in
the *terminating value of the leaving
entity’s assets just before the leaving
time.

To ensure that the value of the
deductions is reflected in the
allocable cost amount.

To ensure that the liabilities,
which are not recognised while
the leaving entity is taken to be
part of the *head company by
subsection 701-1(1), are reflected
in the allocable cost amount.

Subtract from the result of step 3 the
step 4 amount worked out under
section 711-45, which is about:
(a) the leaving entity’s liabilities just
before the leaving time; and

If the amount remaining after step 4 is
positive, it is the old group’s allocable
cost amount for the leaving entity.
Otherwise the old group’s allocable
cost amount is nil.
Note:

If the amount remaining after step 4 is negative, the head company is
taken to have made a capital gain equal to the amount: see CGT event
L5.

Recalculation in order to work out amount of capital loss
(2) If it is necessary to work out whether the *head company makes a
capital loss for a *CGT event that happens at or after the leaving
time in relation to any of the *membership interests, the old
group’s allocable cost amount for the leaving entity is instead
worked out as if the head company’s *terminating value for any
asset covered by subsection 705-30(4) (as it applies for the
purposes of section 711-30) were instead equal to the asset’s
*reduced cost base just before the leaving time.

Section 711-25
711-25 Terminating values of the leaving entity’s assets—step 1 in
working out allocable cost amount
(1) For the purposes of step 1 in the table in subsection 711-20(1), the
step 1 amount is worked out by adding up the *head company’s
*terminating values of all the assets that the head company holds at
the leaving time because the leaving entity is taken by
subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) to be a part of the head
company.
Goodwill
(2) If loss of control and ownership of the leaving entity by the *head
company would decrease the *market value of the goodwill
associated with assets or businesses of the old group (other than
those of the leaving entity), the head company’s *cost base of the
asset consisting of goodwill that it holds at the leaving time
because of its control and ownership of the leaving entity is added
to the step 1 amount.
Note:

If the asset arose because the head company acquired control and
ownership of a joining entity, subsection 705-35(3) would have
applied in relation to the joining entity. The asset could also have
arisen e.g. because the head company acquired a business from an
entity without acquiring the entity.

Increase in step 1 amount for certain former privatised assets
(3) If:
(a) the *head company of the old group *holds a *depreciating
asset at the leaving time because the leaving entity is taken
by subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) to be a part of
the head company; and
(b) the asset’s *tax cost was set at the *tax cost setting amount
when an entity (whether the leaving entity or another entity)
became a *subsidiary member of the old group; and
(c) the tax cost setting amount for the asset was reduced because
of section 705-47 (which is about certain assets that were
*privatised assets);

by subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) to be a part of
the head company; and
(b) the first element of the *cost of the asset was worked out by
reference to subsection 58-70(5) because a *member of the
old group acquired the asset as described in
subsection 58-5(4) on or after 1 July 2002; and

(1) The *head company’s terminating value for an asset that it holds at
the leaving time because the leaving entity is taken by
subsection 701-1(1) to be a part of the head company is worked out
as follows.
(2) The amount is worked out by applying section 705-30 in a
corresponding way to the way that section applies to work out the
*terminating value for an asset that a joining entity holds at the
joining time.

711-45 Liabilities etc. owed by the leaving entity—step 4 in working
out allocable cost amount
(1) For the purposes of step 4 in the table in subsection 711-20(1), the
step 4 amount is worked out by adding up the amounts of each
thing (an accounting liability) that, in accordance with the leaving
entity’s *accounting principles for tax cost setting, is a liability of
the leaving entity just before the leaving time.
Leaving entity’s accounting principles for tax cost setting
(1A) The leaving entity’s accounting principles for tax cost setting are
the *accounting principles that the group would use if it were to
prepare its financial statements just before the leaving time
(disregarding subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule)).
Exclusion for deferred tax liability
(1B) An amount is not to be added for an accounting liability that is an
amount recorded in a deferred tax liability account in accordance
with the leaving entity’s *accounting principles for tax cost setting.

relates to an asset mentioned in paragraph 713-575(2)(a) or (b)
(certain assets of life insurance company).
Exclusion where transfer of accounting liability
(2) An amount is not to be added for an accounting liability that arises
because of the leaving entity’s ownership of an asset if, on
*disposal of the asset, the accounting liability will transfer to the
new owner.

(2) The object of this section is to ensure that the *tax cost setting
amount for *membership interests that each entity holds in another
entity reflects a proportion of the other entity’s cost for its net
assets.
Tax cost setting amounts to be worked out for certain membership
interests in all of the entities
(3) A *tax cost setting amount must be worked out for each
*membership interest (the subject interest) that one of the entities
holds in another of the entities just before the leaving time, and this
must be done:
(a) by applying section 711-15 to the subject interest as if:
(i) a reference in that section, or any provision of this
Division that relates to it, to any membership interest
that *members of the old group hold in the leaving
entity were a reference to the subject interest; and
(ii) a reference in that section, or any provision of this
Division that relates to it, to liabilities owed by
members of the old group included a reference to
liabilities owed by any of the entities that cease to be
*subsidiary members of the old group at the leaving
time; and
(b) by working out the tax cost setting amount for membership
interests in entities that are held by other entities before

Tax cost setting amount for membership interests acquired by head
company
(4) Then work out the *tax cost setting amount mentioned in
paragraph 711-10(a) for the *membership interests held by the
*head company in the same way as under section 711-15.
Note:

In doing so, tax cost setting amounts worked out under subsection (3)
of this section for membership interests held by the leaving entity in
other entities will be taken into account in working out the allocable
cost amount for the leaving entity. Those tax cost setting amounts will
in turn have been affected by any other tax cost setting amounts
worked out under subsection (3) for membership interests in other
entities.

Tax cost setting amount for membership interests acquired by
leaving entity
(5) The *tax cost setting amount mentioned in paragraph 711-10(b) for
*membership interests of which the leaving entity becomes the
holder will be one of the tax cost setting amounts worked out under
subsection (3) of this section.
Example: Companies A, B, C, D and E are all subsidiary members that leave the
old group at the same time. Just before the leaving time, company A
owned shares in company B and company C, and company B owned
shares in companies D and E.
First, work out company A’s tax cost setting amount for membership
interests in company C and company B’s tax cost setting amount for
membership interests in companies D and E by applying
section 711-15 in accordance with paragraph (3)(a) above.
Next, work out company A’s tax cost setting amount for membership
interests in company B under that section as so applied, taking into
account the tax cost setting amount just worked out for company B’s
assets consisting of shares in companies D and E.
Finally, work out the head company’s tax cost setting amount for
membership interests in company A under section 711-15 in
accordance with subsection (4) above, taking into account the tax cost
setting amounts worked out for companies B and C.

When this section applies
(1) This section applies unless:
(a) Subdivision 705-C (about one group joining another
consolidated group) applies in relation to the old group; and
(b) the leaving entity is a *subsidiary member of the old group.
(1A) To avoid doubt, this section applies regardless of whether the

Number of pre-CGT membership interests
(3) The number is the result of the formula in subsection (4), rounded
down to:

(6) The amount under this subsection is the old group’s *allocable cost
amount for the leaving entity, worked out on the assumption that
the leaving entity ceased to be a *subsidiary member of the old
group just after the Division 149 time.

711-75 Additional integrity rule if membership interests treated as

(1) This section applies if the leaving entity ceases to be a *subsidiary
member of the old group because of a situation giving rise to *CGT
event A1, C2, E1, E2 or E8 in relation to one or more *membership
interests in the leaving entity.
(2) For the purposes of applying subsections 104-230(2) and (8) in
relation to those *membership interests:
(a) disregard subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) in
working out the *net value of the leaving entity; and
(b) treat the reference in subsection 104-230(2) to “Just before
the other event happened” as a reference to “Just before the
leaving time”.
Note 1:

The single entity rule will continue to apply in determining whether
the property mentioned in subsection 104-230(2) for the leaving entity
was acquired on or after 20 September 1985.

Note 2:

However, in a case of multiple exit from a consolidated group (see
section 711-55), the property mentioned in subsection 104-230(2) for
the leaving entity may include membership interests in another entity
leaving the group at the leaving time. To determine which of those
membership interests were acquired on or after 20 September 1985 for
the purposes of applying subsection 104-230(2) to the leaving entity,
see section 711-65.

(3) In determining the sum of the *cost bases of the property
mentioned in subsection 104-230(6), treat the cost base of an asset
that is included in that property as:

(b) some or all of the *membership interests in the trust are
neither units nor interests in the trust; and
(c) some or all of the trust capital is settled capital that could be
distributed tax free at the joining time.
The increase in the step 1 amount takes account of the settled
capital that could be distributed tax free.
Note 1:

As a result, the settled capital that could be distributed tax free is
treated in a way that is analogous to the group’s cost of acquiring the
trust: see subsection 705-10(2).

Note 2:

Paragraph (1)(b) reflects the position that a distribution in respect of a
unit or interest in the trust is generally covered by CGT event E4 and
so is not tax-free: see section 104-70.

(2) The step 1 amount worked out under section 705-65 is increased
by the amount worked out under the following method statement
if, at the joining time, there are *membership interests (the
discretionary interests) in the trust each of which satisfies these
conditions:
(a) it is neither a unit nor an interest in the trust;
(b) the entity that owned it at the joining time began to own it
only because money or property was settled on the trust;
(c) it either has no *cost base or it has a cost base of nil.
Note:

If a membership interest has a cost base greater than nil, the cost base
is already taken into account in working out the step 1 amount under
section 705-65.

Method statement
Step 1.

Add up:
(a)

each amount settled on the trust before or at the
joining time; and

(b)

the *market value of each item of property settled
on the trust before or at the joining time, worked
out as at when the item was settled;

(a)

the entire trust capital and trust income had been
realised and distributed; and

(b)

the trust had ended.

Step 3.

Step 4.

This may involve determining how a power of

would have been included in the assessable income
of any *member of the trust who owned any of the
discretionary interests at the joining time; or

(b)

would have been taken into account in working out

Work out how much of the step 1 amount consists of one
or more of these:
(a)

an amount settled on the trust directly by the *head
company of the *consolidated group (whether or
not the group was in existence when the amount or

company, choose to form such a group (with other entities as
*subsidiary members).

which that law applies in relation to a company.
Note:

The law relating to income tax includes legislation relating to
associated imposts (such as those connected with the imputation
system).

Choice to form a consolidated group
713-130 Choosing to form a consolidated group
A trust may make a choice under section 703-50 (Choice to
consolidate a consolidatable group), as if the trust were a company
(the assumed company), but only if:
(a) the assumed company could make the choice, if it
beneficially owned the *membership interests in other entities
that are legally owned by the trustee; and
(b) the day specified in the choice is the first day of an income
year for which the trust is a *public trading trust.
Note:

Assuming that a trust is a company also involves assuming:
(a) that the company has characteristics of the trust, such as the
location of the central management and control (which is
relevant to residence), the business of the trust, not being
incorporated etc.; and
(b) that membership interests in the trust are membership interests in
the company (owned by the same persons and in the same way as
membership interests in the trust are owned); and
(c) that the company’s taxable income is taxed at the same rate as
the trust’s net income.

(a) with the appropriate modifications (including those described
in section 713-140, so far as they are appropriate); and
(b) in relation to all times at or after the start of the day specified
in the choice; and
(c) so far as it is relevant to the operation of the applied law in
relation to the trust and a time at or after the start of that
day—in relation to a time when the trust existed before the
start of that day.
Note 1:

The application of the applied law in this way affects not only the trust
and the trustee but also other entities connected with the trust, such as

the choice; and
(b) there may be a scrip for scrip roll-over for an entity exchanging
its shares in a company for membership interests in the trust.

Note 2:

The application of the applied law in this way involves treatment of
characteristics, things and persons relating to the trust corresponding
to the treatment by the applied law of analogous characteristics, things
and persons relating to a company (as envisaged in the note to
section 713-130). These are some examples of analogous things and
analogous persons:
(a) units in the trust and shares in a company;
(b) unitholders in the trust and shareholders in a company;
(c) trust voting interests and voting shares in a company.

(2) The applied law is:
(a) this Act (other than this Subdivision); and
(b) an Act that imposes any impost payable under this Act; and
(c) the Income Tax Rates Act 1986; and
(d) the Taxation Administration Act 1953, so far as it relates to
an Act covered by paragraph (a), (b) or (c); and
(e) any other Act, so far as it relates to an Act covered by
paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d); and
(f) regulations and other legislative instruments under an Act
covered by any of the preceding paragraphs.
(3) Subsection (1) does not make an entity liable to a criminal, civil or
administrative penalty.

Objects
713-205 Objects of this Subdivision
(1) The first object of this Subdivision is to ensure that if:
(a) an entity that is a partner in a partnership becomes a
*subsidiary member of a *consolidated group; and
(b) the partnership does not become a *subsidiary member of the
group;
the provisions mentioned in subsection (3) operate as if the
*partnership cost setting interests of the entity in the partnership
were the entity’s only assets relating to the partnership.
Note:

In general, the head company of the consolidated group is treated as a
partner in the partnership, in accordance with section 701-1 (the single
entity rule).

(2) The second object of this Subdivision is to ensure that where a
partnership becomes a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated
group, the provisions mentioned in subsection (3) operate:
(a) as if the group became the holder of the assets of the
partnership; and
(b) to set the *tax cost of the assets of the partnership at an
appropriate amount, taking into account the taxation
treatment of partnerships.
Note:

While the partnership is a subsidiary member of the group, it loses its
separate tax identity (under the single entity rule in
subsection 701-1(1)). Therefore, in general, the assets of the
partnership are treated as assets of the head company of the group and
partnership cost setting interests in the partnership are ignored.

(3) The provisions are:
(a) section 701-10 (about setting the tax cost of assets of an
entity joining a group); and

Note:

An example of provisions covered by paragraph (c) are the provisions
of Subdivision 705-B giving Subdivision 705-A a modified effect
when a consolidated group is formed.

(4) The third object of this Subdivision is to ensure that, where a
partnership ceases to be a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated
group, the provisions mentioned in subsection (5) operate:
(a) as if the group’s *partnership cost setting interests were the
group’s only assets relating to the partnership; and
(b) to set the *tax cost of those interests at an appropriate
amount, taking into account the fact that the group ceases to
be the holder of the assets of the partnership.
(5) The provisions are:
(a) sections 701-15 and 701-50 (about setting the tax cost of
membership interests in an entity that leaves the group); and
(b) sections 701-20 and 701-45 (about the cost of assets
consisting of certain liabilities owed by or to an entity that
leaves the group); and
(c) Division 711.

Partnership cost setting interests etc.
713-210 Partnership cost setting interests
A partnership cost setting interest in a partnership is the asset that
is comprised of:
(a) an interest in an asset of the partnership; or
(b) an interest in the partnership that is not covered by
paragraph (a);
but does not include an asset that is comprised of a *membership
interest in the partnership.

Section 713-215
Note 1:

A partner may have more than one partnership cost setting interest
that relates to an asset of the partnership (see section 106-5).

Note 2:

A partnership cost setting interest may relate to an asset of the
partnership, but the asset of the partnership is not a partnership cost
setting interest in the partnership.

713-215 Terminating value for partnership cost setting interest
(1) This section modifies the way in which the *terminating value of a
*partnership cost setting interest in a partnership is worked out
under section 705-30.
(2) For the purposes of this Subdivision, the *terminating value of the
*partnership cost setting interest at a time is:
(a) if the interest relates to an asset of the partnership—the
interest’s individual share of the terminating value of that
asset (worked out in accordance with subsection (3)) at that
time; or
(b) otherwise—the terminating value of the interest at that time
worked out under section 705-30.
(3) To work out the amount of the *terminating value of the asset of
the partnership mentioned in paragraph (2)(a), apply
section 705-30 as if:
(a) the time mentioned in subsection (2) were the joining time
mentioned in that section; and
(b) the partnership were, at the time mentioned in subsection (2),
the joining entity mentioned in that section.

Setting tax cost of partnership cost setting interests

Section 713-225
Note:

If the partnership becomes a subsidiary member of the group at the
joining time, the application of this section is affected by
section 713-235.

(2) In applying the provisions mentioned in subsection 713-205(3) in
relation to the joining entity:
(a) work out the *tax cost setting amount for each *partnership
cost setting interest in the partnership that the joining entity
holds at the joining time, in accordance with section 713-225;
and
(b) except for the purposes of section 713-235 (which applies
only if the partnership joins the group), do not work out tax
cost setting amounts for the assets of the partnership; and
(c) do not work out tax cost setting amounts for the *membership
interests in the partnership held by the joining entity.
Note 1:

Because of paragraphs (b) and (c), no amount of allocable cost amount
for the joining entity is allocated to the assets of the partnership, or to
membership interests in the partnership held by the joining entity.

Note 2:

If assets of the partnership are held on revenue account, the related
partnership cost setting interests held by the joining entity have their
tax cost set at the joining time. However, that tax cost does not alter
calculations of the net income or exempt income of the partnership, or
of a partnership loss, for the purposes of section 92 of the Income Tax
Assessment Act 1936.

713-225 Tax cost setting amount for partnership cost setting interest
(1) This section modifies the way in which the *tax cost setting
amounts are worked out under Division 705 for the *partnership
cost setting interests mentioned in paragraph 713-220(2)(a).
Partnership cost setting interest takes character of partnership
asset—general
(2) Work out the *tax cost setting amounts for those *partnership cost
setting interests as if any partnership cost setting interest that
relates to an asset (the underlying partnership asset) of the
partnership were an asset of the same kind as the underlying
partnership asset.

Section 713-225
Note:

The kinds of assets mentioned in subsection (2) include the following:
(a) retained cost base assets;
(b) reset cost base assets that are held on revenue account (however,
if such assets are trading stock or depreciating assets, the special
rule in subsection (4) will apply) or on capital account;
(c) excluded assets (see subsection (3));
(d) current assets (within the meaning of subsection 705-125(2)).

Example: The partnership has an asset that is Australian currency (which is a
retained cost base asset). A partnership cost setting interest of the
joining entity in that asset is treated as a retained cost base asset for
the purpose of working out the tax cost setting amounts for the joining
entity’s partnership cost setting interests in the partnership.

Partnership cost setting interest takes character of partnership
asset—excluded assets
(3) If:
(a) tax cost setting amounts were to be worked out for the assets
of the partnership under Division 705; and
(b) in working out those amounts, the underlying partnership
asset mentioned in subsection (2) would be an excluded asset
for the purposes of section 705-35;
then subsection (2) operates so that the *tax cost setting amounts
for those *partnership cost setting interests are worked out as if any
partnership cost setting interest that relates to the underlying
partnership asset were an excluded asset for the purposes of
section 705-35.
Special character of partnership cost setting interest in partnership
asset that is trading stock, a depreciating asset or a registered
emissions unit
(4) Despite subsection (2), if an asset of the partnership is *trading
stock, a *depreciating asset or a *registered emissions unit, work
out the *tax cost setting amounts for those *partnership cost setting
interests as if:
(a) a partnership cost setting interest relating to that asset were a
*retained cost base asset; and

Partnership liabilities—working out allocable cost amount
(6) If:
(a) in accordance with the *accounting principles that the
partnership would use if it were to prepare its financial
statements just before the joining time, a thing (the
partnership liability) is a liability of the partnership at the
joining time; and
(b) for that reason, the partnership liability is not an accounting
liability of the joining entity at the joining time for the
purposes of section 705-70;
then sections 705-70, 705-75 and 705-80 operate as if the
partnership liability were an accounting liability of the joining
entity at the joining time, to the extent of the joining entity’s
individual share of the partnership liability.
Partnership deductions—working out allocable cost amount
(7) Section 705-115 operates as if:
(a) a deduction to which the partnership is entitled (the
partnership deduction) were a deduction to which the
joining entity was entitled, to the extent of the joining
entity’s individual share of the partnership deduction; and
(b) the deduction to which the joining entity was entitled were of
the same kind as the partnership deduction.
Note:

These kinds of deductions include acquired deductions and
owned deductions (within the meaning of section 705-115).

(2) In applying the provisions mentioned in subsection 713-205(3) in

(a) do not work out an allocable cost amount for the partnership;
and
(b) work out the *tax cost setting amount for each asset of the
partnership covered by subsection (3), in accordance with
section 713-240.
Note:

If a partner in the partnership becomes a subsidiary member of the
group at the joining time, tax cost setting amounts are worked out for
the assets of the partner (including partnership cost setting interests)
before tax cost setting amounts are worked out for the assets of the
partnership.

(3) An asset of the partnership at the joining time is covered by this
subsection, unless it would be an excluded asset for the purposes of
section 705-35 on the assumption that tax cost setting amounts
were worked out for the assets of the partnership under
Division 705 (instead of section 713-240).

713-240 Partnership joins group—tax cost setting amount for

(1) Work out the *tax cost setting amounts for the assets covered by
subsection 713-235(3) as follows:
(a) firstly, add up the subsection (2) amounts for all the
partnership cost setting interests in the partnership at the
joining time (the result is the partnership cost pool);
Note 1: Partnership cost setting interests held by a partner that becomes a
subsidiary member of the group at the joining time are included
in the calculation in paragraph (a). The operation of the cost
setting rules in relation to that partner at the joining time may
affect the subsection (2) amounts for those interests.
Note 2: Partnership cost setting interests are included in the calculation in
paragraph (a), even if the cost setting rules have not applied in
relation to the interests (for example, if the interests were
acquired directly by the head company).

(b) secondly, work out the tax cost setting amounts for the assets
covered by subsection 713-235(3) that are *retained cost base
assets, in accordance with section 705-25;

setting interests in the partnership to be worked out. Where other
entities cease to be *subsidiary members at the same time, the
normal tax cost setting amount rules are applied for membership

cost setting interests in the partnership.

713-260 Partnership leaves group—tax cost setting amount for
assets consisting of being owed certain liabilities
(1) This section applies if:
(a) when the partnership ceases to be a *subsidiary member of
the group, a partner remains a *member of the group; and
(b) an asset becomes an asset of the *head company because
subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) ceases to apply to
the partnership when it ceases to be a subsidiary member;
and
(c) the asset is, ignoring that subsection:
(i) the partner’s interest in an asset of the partnership
consisting of a liability of a member of the group owed
to the partnership; or
(ii) the partner’s share of a liability of the partnership owed
to a member of the group.
(2) The asset’s *tax cost is set at the leaving time at a *tax cost setting
amount equal to the *market value of the asset.

713-265 Partnership leaves group—adjustments to allocable cost
amount of partner who also leaves group
(1) This section has effect in working out the group’s *allocable cost
amount for a partner in the partnership, if the partner ceases to be a
*subsidiary member of the group at the leaving time.
(2) Section 711-35 operates as if:
(a) a deduction to which the partnership becomes entitled (the
partnership deduction) were a deduction to which the
partner becomes entitled, to the extent of the partner’s
individual share of the partnership deduction; and
(b) the deduction to which the partner becomes entitled were of
the same kind as the partnership deduction.

These kinds of deductions include acquired deductions and owned

(3) Section 711-40 operates as if a liability owed by *members of the
group to the partnership at the leaving time were a liability owed
by members of the group to the partner at that time, to the extent of
the partner’s individual share of the liability.
(4) If:
(a) in accordance with the *accounting principles that the
partnership would use if it were to prepare its financial
statements just before the leaving time (disregarding
subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule)), a thing (the
partnership liability) is a liability of the partnership just
before the leaving time; and
(b) for that reason, the partnership liability is not an accounting
liability of the partner just before the leaving time for the
purposes of section 711-45;
then section 711-45 operates as if the partnership liability were an
accounting liability of the partner just before the leaving time, to
the extent of the partner’s individual share of the partnership
liability.

Section 713-511

Life insurance companies’ liabilities on joining consolidated
group
713-511 Treatment of certain liabilities for income year when life
insurance company joins consolidated group
(1) This section affects how paragraph 320-15(1)(h) and
section 320-85 apply if:
(a) a *life insurance company becomes a *subsidiary member of
a *consolidated group at a time (the joining time); and
(b) just before the joining time, the life insurance company had
one or more liabilities under the *net risk components of life
insurance policies.
Note:

Paragraph 320-15(1)(h) and section 320-85 both operate on the basis
of a comparison of the value of the company’s liabilities under the net
risk components of life insurance policies at the end of the current
year with the value of those liabilities at the end of the previous year,
so that:
(a) that paragraph includes an amount in the company’s assessable
income for the current year if the value at the end of the current
year is less than the value at the end of the previous income year;
and
(b) that section allows a deduction for the current year if the value at
the end of the current year is more than the value at the end of
the previous income year.

(2) The object of this section is to ensure that the *head company of
the *consolidated group bears the income tax consequences relating
to a change in *value of the liabilities only after the joining time.
Note:

The life insurance company bears the income tax consequences
relating to a change in value of the liabilities before the joining time,
because section 701-30 ensures that paragraph 320-15(1)(h) and
section 320-85 apply in relation to a part of the income year before
that time when the company was not a subsidiary member of a
consolidated group as if that part were an income year.

(3) Paragraph 320-15(1)(h) and section 320-85 apply for the head
company core purposes set out in section 701-1 (Single entity rule)
as if the *value of the liabilities at the end of the last income year

Tax cost setting rules for life insurance companies joining
consolidated group
713-515 Certain assets taken to be retained cost base assets where
life insurance company joins group
(1) If an entity that becomes a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated
group at a time (the joining time) is a *life insurance company,
these assets are retained cost base assets:
(a) a *complying superannuation asset, or a *segregated exempt
asset, of the company; and
(b) another asset of the company that is held by the company for
the purpose of discharging its liabilities under the *net
investment component of ordinary life insurance policies
(except policies that provide for *participating benefits or
*discretionary benefits under *life insurance business carried
on in Australia); and
(c) for a life insurance company that has demutualised under
Division 9AA of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act
1936 where, in the period starting just after the company
demutualises and ending at the joining time, all of the
*membership interests in the company were owned by the
same group—a goodwill asset of the company.
(2) If the *retained cost base asset is covered by paragraph (1)(a) or
(b), its *tax cost setting amount is:
(a) for the purposes of working out the tax cost setting amounts
for reset cost base assets (see section 705-35)—the asset’s
*transfer value just before the joining time; and
(b) for all other purposes—the asset’s *terminating value.
(3) If the *retained cost base asset is covered by paragraph (1)(c), its
*tax cost setting amount is the embedded value (see

(a) the liability is under the *net risk component of a *life
insurance policy; and
(b) the joining entity could deduct under section 320-80 an
amount for the *risk component of claims paid under the
policy had it not become a *member of the *consolidated

713-550 Treatment of head company’s franking account after
joining
Sections 709-70 and 709-75 do not apply in relation to a
*subsidiary member of a *consolidated group if:
(a) the subsidiary member is a *life insurance company; or
(b) a life insurance company that is a *member of the group
owns *membership interests, either directly or indirectly
through one or more interposed entities, in the subsidiary

Liabilities for life insurance companies leaving consolidated
group
713-565 Treatment of certain liabilities for income year when life
insurance company leaves consolidated group
(1) This section affects how paragraph 320-15(1)(h) and
section 320-85 apply if:
(a) a *life insurance company ceases to be a *subsidiary member
of a *consolidated group at a time (the leaving time); and
(b) at the leaving time, the *life insurance company has one or
more liabilities under the *net risk components of life
insurance policies.
Note:

Paragraph 320-15(1)(h) and section 320-85 both operate on the basis
of a comparison of the value of a life insurance company’s liabilities
under the net risk components of life insurance policies at the end of
the current year with the value of those liabilities at the end of the
previous year, so that:
(a) that paragraph includes an amount in the company’s assessable
income for the current year if the value at the end of the current
year is less than the value at the end of the previous income year;
and
(b) that section allows a deduction for the current year if the value at
the end of the current year is more than the value at the end of
the previous income year.

(Single entity rule) relating to the income year in which the leaving
time occurs (but not later income years), paragraph 320-15(1)(h)
and section 320-85 have effect as if:
(a) the *head company of the *consolidated group had the
liabilities at the end of that income year; and
(b) the *value of the liabilities at the end of that income year had
been the amount that was actually the value of the liabilities
(for the *life insurance company) at the leaving time.

(b) ignoring section 713-505, at the leaving time, no other
*member of the group is a life insurance company that has a
*complying superannuation asset pool; and
(c) at the leaving time, the *head company has either:
(i) a *tax loss of the *complying superannuation class; or
(ii) a *net capital loss from *complying superannuation
assets.
(2) This Act operates (except so far as the contrary intention appears)
for the purposes of income years ending after the leaving time as if:
(a) the *life insurance company had made the loss for the income
year in which the leaving time occurs; and
(b) the *head company had not made the loss for the income year
for which it made the loss.
Note:

Section 707-410 (Exit history rule does not treat entity as having made
a loss) does not prevent the life insurance company from having the
loss under this section, because that section merely states that the
company is not taken under section 701-40 (Exit history rule) to have
made a loss.

(3) The *life insurance company is not prevented from *utilising the
loss for the income year in which the leaving time occurs merely
because this Act operates as if the life insurance company had
made the loss for that year.

*transfer value of the asset at the leaving time, if the asset is:
(a) a *complying superannuation asset, or a *segregated exempt
asset, of the head company; or
(b) held by the head company for the purpose of discharging its

life insurance policies (except policies that provide for
*participating benefits or *discretionary benefits under *life
insurance business carried on in Australia).

713-580 Valuing certain liabilities where life insurance company
leaves group
(1) Despite section 711-45, if the leaving entity mentioned in step 4 in
the table in section 711-20 is a *life insurance company, the
leaving entity’s liabilities mentioned in this section are to be valued
as mentioned in this section.
(2) To avoid doubt, those liabilities are the liabilities that become
those of the leaving entity because section 701-1 (Single entity
rule) ceases to apply to the leaving entity when it ceases to be a
*subsidiary member of the group.
(3) The value of the leaving entity’s *complying superannuation
liabilities (if any) is the amount worked out under section 320-190
at the leaving time.
(4) The value of the leaving entity’s *exempt life insurance policy
liabilities (if any) is the amount worked out under section 320-245
at the leaving time.
(5) Subsection (6) applies to a liability of the leaving entity if:
(a) the liability is under the *net risk component of a *life
insurance policy; and
(b) the leaving entity could deduct under section 320-80 an
amount for the *risk component of claims paid under the
policy on or after the time it ceased to be a *member of the
*consolidated group.

Section 713-710

Liabilities and reserves of general insurance companies joining
and leaving consolidated groups
713-710 Treatment of liabilities and reserves for income year when
general insurance company joins or leaves group
Sections 713-715 and 713-720 affect how sections 321-10, 321-15,
321-50 and 321-55 (the affected sections) apply in relation to these
values (the affected values):
(a) the value of a *general insurance company’s adjusted
*liability for incurred claims under *general insurance
policies that is worked out under section 321-20;
(b) the value of a general insurance company’s adjusted *liability
for remaining coverage under general insurance policies that
is worked out under section 321-60.
Note 1:

Sections 321-10 and 321-15 both operate on the basis of a comparison
of the value of a general insurance company’s adjusted liability for
incurred claims at the end of the current year with the value of that
liability at the end of the previous income year, so that:
(a) section 321-10 includes an amount in the company’s assessable
income for the current year if the value at the end of the current
year is less than the value at the end of the previous income year;
and
(b) section 321-15 allows a deduction for the current year if the
value at the end of the current year is more than the value at the
end of the previous income year.

Note 2:

Sections 321-50 and 321-55 both operate on the basis of a comparison
of the value of a general insurance company’s adjusted liability for
remaining coverage at the end of the current year with the value of
that reserve at the end of the previous income year, so that:
(a) section 321-50 includes an amount in the company’s assessable
income for the current year if the value at the end of the current
year is less than the value at the end of the previous income year;
and
(b) section 321-55 allows a deduction for the current year if the
value at the end of the current year is more than the value at the
end of the previous income year.

(2) The object of this section is to ensure that the *head company of
the *consolidated group bears the income tax consequences relating
to changes after the joining time in the affected values.
Note:

The general insurance company bears the income tax consequences
relating to a change in the affected values before the joining time,
because section 701-30 ensures that the affected sections apply in
relation to a part of the income year before that time when the
company was not a subsidiary member of a consolidated group as if
that part were an income year.

(3) The affected sections apply for the head company core purposes set
out in section 701-1 (Single entity rule) as if each of the affected
values at the end of the last income year ending before the joining
time were the amount that would have been that value had that
income year ended just before the joining time.

713-720 If general insurance company leaves consolidated group
(1) This section applies if a *general insurance company ceases to be a
*subsidiary member of a *consolidated group at a time (the leaving
time) in an income year (the leaving year).
(2) The object of this section is to ensure that:
(a) the *head company of the *consolidated group bears the
income tax consequences relating to changes before the
leaving time in the affected values; and
(b) the *general insurance company bears the income tax

(i) a *membership interest that a *member of the group
(including a chosen transitional entity under
Division 701 of the Income Tax (Transitional

(c) on a company becoming a subsidiary member:
(i) a CGT asset of the company that becomes an asset of

(ii) because the company is a chosen transitional entity, the
asset does not have its tax cost reset; and
(iii) the business continuity test is failed;

Section 715-25

Effect on Subdivision 165-CC of a company becoming a
member of a consolidated group
715-25 Subdivision 165-CC stops applying to earlier changeover
time
(1) At and after the time (the membership time) when a company
becomes a *member of a *consolidated group, Subdivision 165-CC
does not apply to the company in relation to a *changeover time
that happened before the membership time, except for the purposes
of section 715-30 (which defines 165-CC tagged asset).
Note 1:

Subdivision 165-CC is about change of ownership or control of a
company that has an unrealised net loss.

Note 2:

If the company has 165-CC tagged assets at the membership time,
there are further consequences under this Subdivision and
Subdivision 715-D.
Also, Subdivision 165-CC can apply to the head company of the
group in relation to a changeover time that happens for it at or after
the membership time. See section 715-75.

(2) Subsection (1) continues to have effect even if the company later
stops being a *member of the group.

715-30 Meaning of 165-CC tagged asset
A *CGT asset is a 165-CC tagged asset of a company at a
particular time if, and only if:
(a) that time is at or after the most recent *changeover time (if
any) for the company; and
(b) at that changeover time, the company had an unrealised net
loss under section 165-115E; and
(c) the asset is covered by subsection 165-115A(1A) as applying
to that changeover time; and
(d) the company would not, at that changeover time, satisfy the
maximum net asset value test under section 152-15; and

Section 715-35
(e) if the company has chosen under subsection 165-115A(1B)
in relation to that changeover time—the company *acquired
the asset for $10,000 or more.

715-35 Meaning of final RUNL
A company’s final RUNL at a particular time (the test time) is the
amount that would have been the company’s *residual unrealised
net loss at the time of:
(a) if no event that subsection 165-115BB(2) refers to as a
relevant event actually happens at the test time—a notional
event of that kind happening at the test time; or
(b) otherwise—a notional event of that kind that happens at the
test time, and that the company determines under
paragraph 165-115BB(1)(b) to have happened later than each
event that actually happened at that time.
Note:

This Subdivision reduces a company’s final RUNL as amounts of it
are applied for various purposes.

165-CC tagged assets that affect tax cost setting amounts
715-50 Step 1 amount is reduced if membership interest in
subsidiary member is 165-CC tagged asset and business
continuity test is failed
(1) The amount taken into account under subsection 705-65(1) (about
the cost of membership interests in the joining entity) for a
*membership interest that a *member of the joined group holds in
the joining entity at the joining time is reduced if:
(a) apart from this section, the amount would be the membership
interest’s *reduced cost base (if appropriate, as modified by a
later provision of section 705-65); and
(b) the membership interest is at that time a *165-CC tagged
asset of that member, and that member owned it at the
*changeover time for that member; and
(c) that member’s *final RUNL just before the joining time was
greater than nil; and

(i) the period (the business continuity test period)
consisting of the *head company’s *trial year; and
(ii) the time (the test time) just before the *changeover time.
(2) If at the joining time that *member holds:
(a) 2 or *more membership interests in the joining entity; or
(b) at least one membership interest in the joining entity, and at
least one membership interest in another member of the
joined group;
this section applies to each such membership interest in whichever
order that member determines.
Amount of reduction
(3) The amount taken into account under subsection 705-65(1) is
reduced to the *membership interest’s *market value at the joining
time.
(4) However, if that member’s *final RUNL (as reduced by any
previous reductions under this section) is less than the difference
between:
(a) the *reduced cost base referred to in paragraph (1)(a); and
(b) the *market value referred to in subsection (3);
the amount taken into account under subsection 705-65(1) is
instead reduced by that final RUNL.
(5) That *final RUNL is reduced by the amount of the reduction under
subsection (3) or (4).
Non-membership equity interests
(6) Subsection 705-65(6) (which treats *non-membership equity
interests as *membership interests) also applies for the purposes of
this section.

subsection 705-75(2) (about reduction of the step 2 amount) for an
accounting liability of the joining entity that is owed to a *member
of the joined group at the joining time is reduced if:

provision of section 705-75) of the asset of that member that
is constituted by the accounting liability; and
(b) the asset is at that time a *165-CC tagged asset of that
member, and that member owned it at the *changeover time;

Note:

Paragraph (1)(c) has the effect that if both this section and

(2) This subsection is satisfied if:
(a) a *CGT asset of the entity, or each of 2 or more CGT assets
of the entity:
(i) is a *165-CC tagged asset of the entity at the formation

715-75 Extension of single entity rule and entry history rule
(1) Subsection 701-1(1) (Single entity rule) and section 701-5 (Entry
history rule) also have effect for all the purposes of
Subdivision 165-CC (about change of ownership or control of a
company that has an unrealised net loss).
Note:

One consequence of this is that the head company is the only member
of a consolidated group that can have a changeover time and be
subject to consequences under Subdivision 165-CC. The head
company is treated as owning all CGT assets owned by group
members, and as making relevant losses.

(2) This section is not intended to limit the effect that
subsection 701-1(1) and section 701-5 have apart from this section.

Section 715-80

Effect on Subdivision 165-CC of entity leaving consolidated
group
715-80 Application of sections 715-85 to 715-110
Sections 715-85 to 715-110 apply if, at a particular time (the
leaving time), an entity (the leaving entity) ceases to be a
*subsidiary member of a *consolidated group.
Note 1:

If a changeover time happened to the head company at or after the
group came into existence and before the leaving time,
Subdivision 165-CC does not apply to the head company at and after
the leaving time, in respect of assets that leave with the leaving entity,
in relation to the changeover time.
This is because the head company can no longer make a capital loss,
or become entitled to a deduction, in respect of a CGT event
happening to any of those assets.

Note 2:

If, just before the leaving time, the head company had a loss denial
pool, see section 715-120.

715-85 First changeover time for leaving company at or after leaving
time
If the leaving entity is a company, its first *changeover time at or
after the leaving time is determined:
(a) on the basis that the reference time under
subsection 165-115A(2A) is the one that would be used in
determining whether the leaving time was a changeover time
for the head company; and
(b) making the additional assumptions in section 715-290.
Note:

If the leaving entity is a trust, it cannot have a changeover time
(because Subdivision 165-CC applies only to companies), so
section 715-95 applies to it instead: see subsection 715-95(2).

Section 715-95
(a) the leaving entity is a company; and
(b) the leaving time is a *changeover time for the leaving entity.
(2) In applying to the leaving entity for the *changeover time that is
the leaving time, subsection 165-115B(3) and
paragraph 165-115BA(5)(c) have effect as if they provided that the
time just after the changeover time were the test time for applying
section 165-13 to the company.
Note:

This ensures that the business continuity test is applied to the business
that the leaving entity carries on at the leaving time.

715-95 If ownership and control of leaving entity have not changed
since head company’s last changeover time
(1) This section applies if:
(a) the leaving entity is a company; and
(b) the leaving time is not a *changeover time for the leaving
entity; and
(c) just before the leaving time, the *head company owned at
least one *CGT asset:
(i) that was a *165-CC tagged asset just before the leaving
time; and
(ii) that it owned at the latest changeover time for the head
company at or after the group came into existence and
before the leaving time; and
(d) at least one asset covered by paragraph (c) is an asset (a
leaving asset) that becomes an asset of the leaving entity at
the leaving time because subsection 701-1(1) (Single entity
rule) ceases to apply to the entity; and
(e) the head company’s *final RUNL at the leaving time is
greater than nil.

(ii) when the head company came into existence;

(b) the time (the test time) just before the *changeover time;

Note:

For provisions about making one of these choices, see
sections 715-175 to 715-185.

715-100 First choice: adjustable values of leaving assets reduced to
nil
The first choice is to reduce the *adjustable value of each leaving
asset to nil. The choice has effect accordingly, just before the
leaving time. The *head company’s *final RUNL is not reduced
because of it.
Note:

The consequences of the choice are worked out under

715-105 Second choice: head company’s final RUNL applied in
reducing adjustable values of leaving assets that are loss
assets
(1) The second choice is to reduce under this section the *adjustable
value of each leaving asset (a loss asset) for which the *head
company would have had a notional capital loss, or notional
revenue loss, under section 165-115F at the time (the test time) just
before the leaving time if the test time had been a *changeover time
for the head company. The choice has effect accordingly.

(a) 2 or more entities cease to be *subsidiary members of the
*consolidated group at the leaving time; and
(b) 2 or more of them make the second choice;
the choices have effect in whichever order the *head company
determines.
(3) This section applies to each of the loss assets in order, according to
their respective *adjustable values (apart from this section) at the
test time: from largest to smallest. (If an asset has more than one
such adjustable value, use the greater or greatest of them.)
(4) At the test time, the *adjustable value of the loss asset is reduced to
the asset’s *market value at that time.
(5) However, if the *head company’s *final RUNL at the leaving time
(as reduced by any previous reductions under this section) is less
than the difference between:
(a) the *adjustable value of the loss asset (apart from this
section) at the test time; and
(b) the asset’s *market value at the test time;
the adjustable value is instead reduced at the test time by that final
RUNL.
(6) That *final RUNL is reduced by the amount of the reduction under
subsection (4) or (5). If 2 or more such reductions are made for the
same asset (because it has 2 or more different characters), that final
RUNL is reduced by the greater or greatest of the reductions.

715-110 Third choice: loss denial pool of leaving entity created
(1) The third choice can be made only if every asset covered by
paragraph 715-95(1)(c) is a leaving asset. The choice is to have a
loss denial pool of the leaving entity created at the leaving time,
consisting of every leaving asset. (To avoid doubt, the choice can
be made even if the leaving entity is not a company.)
(2) A choice under this section has effect accordingly. The pool is
distinct from any other loss denial pool of the leaving entity.

group; and
(b) just before the leaving time, the *head company had a *loss

that was in the pool just before that time becomes a CGT
asset of the leaving entity because subsection 701-1(1)
(Single entity rule) ceases to apply to the entity;
(2) Each leaving asset leaves the *loss denial pool at the leaving time.
(3) If:
(a) the leaving entity is a company and the leaving time is not a

(b) the leaving entity is a trust;
the *head company must make one of the choices for which

Section 715-125
715-125 First choice: adjustable values of leaving assets reduced to
nil
The first choice is to reduce the *adjustable value of each leaving
asset to nil. The choice has effect accordingly, just before the
leaving time. The *loss denial balance of the *head company’s
*loss denial pool is not reduced because of it.
Note:

The consequences of the choice are worked out under
section 715-145.

715-130 Second choice: pool’s loss denial balance applied in
reducing adjustable values of leaving assets that are loss
assets
(1) The second choice is to reduce under this section the *adjustable
value of each leaving asset (a loss asset) for which the *head
company would have had a notional capital loss, or notional
revenue loss, under section 165-115F at the time (the test time) just
before the leaving time if the test time had been a *changeover time
for the head company. The choice has effect accordingly.
Note:

The consequences of the choice are worked out under this section and
section 715-145.

(2) If:
(a) 2 or more entities cease to be *subsidiary members of the
*consolidated group; and
(b) 2 or more of them make the second choice;
the choices have effect in the same order as the entities cease being
subsidiary members. If 2 or more of the entities ceased at the same
time, their choices have effect in whichever order the *head
company determines.
(3) This section applies to each of the loss assets in order, according to
their respective *adjustable values (apart from this section) at the
test time: from largest to smallest. (If an asset has more than one
such adjustable value, use the greater or greatest of them.)

Section 715-135
(4) At the test time, the *adjustable value of the loss asset is reduced to
the asset’s *market value at that time.
(5) However, if the *loss denial balance (as reduced by any previous
reductions under this section or section 715-160) of the *head
company’s *loss denial pool is less than the difference between:
(a) the *adjustable value of the loss asset (apart from this
section) at the test time; and
(b) the asset’s *market value at the test time;
the adjustable value is instead reduced at the test time by that loss
denial balance.
(6) That *loss denial balance is reduced at the leaving time by the
amount of the reduction under subsection (3) or (4). If 2 or more
such reductions are made for the same asset (because it has 2 or
more different characters), that loss denial balance is reduced by
the greater or greatest of the reductions.

715-135 Third choice: loss denial pool of leaving entity created
(1) The third choice can be made only if every asset that was in the
*loss denial pool just before the leaving time is a leaving asset. The
choice is to have a loss denial pool of the leaving entity created at
the leaving time, consisting of every leaving asset. (To avoid
doubt, the choice can be made even if the leaving entity is not a
company.)
(2) A choice under this section has effect accordingly. The pool is
distinct from any other loss denial pool of the leaving entity.
(3) When the leaving entity’s loss denial pool is created, its loss denial
balance equals the loss denial balance of the head company’s loss
denial pool (as reduced by any previous reductions under
section 715-130 or 715-160).
Note:

If the head company makes this choice, the leaving entity can choose
to cancel the loss denial pool by reducing reduced cost bases of assets
in the pool: see section 715-185.

Effect of first and second choices on various kinds of assets
715-145 Effect of choice on adjustable value of leaving asset
(1) This section has effect for the purposes of determining the
consequences of a choice under any of sections 715-100, 715-105,
715-125, 715-130 and 715-185 (the choice provisions) for a
leaving asset.
(2) The asset’s adjustable value at the time (the test time) just before

in subsection (2) of this section is reduced by the same amount.
(4) Subsection (3) has effect for the purposes of working out under
section 711-30 the *head company’s *terminating value for the
asset at the leaving time.

General provisions about loss denial pools
715-155 When asset leaves pool
A *CGT asset leaves a *loss denial pool:
(a) just after a *realisation event happens to the asset, unless the
realisation event is the ending of an income year (in the case
of an item of *trading stock); or
(b) as mentioned in subsection 715-120(2) (when it becomes an
asset of the leaving entity).

715-160 How loss denial balance is applied to losses realised on
assets in pool
(1) If, apart from this section, a loss would be *realised for income tax
purposes by a *realisation event that happens to a *CGT asset when
it is in a *loss denial pool of an entity, the loss is reduced by the
lesser of:
(a) the amount of the loss; and

does, unless the *realisation event happens before the leaving time
referred to in that section.

715-165 When pool ceases to exist
(1) A *loss denial pool of a company ceases to exist when there is a
*changeover time for the company.
Note:

The CGT assets in the pool then become subject to the application of
Subdivision 165-CC (about change of ownership or control of a
company that has an unrealised net loss).

(2) A *loss denial pool of any entity ceases to exist:
(a) when there are no *CGT assets, and no *170-D deferred
losses, in the pool; or
(b) just after the *loss denial balance becomes nil; or
(c) when the entity becomes a *subsidiary member of a
*consolidated group; or
(d) as mentioned in subsection 715-135(4).

Choices under this Subdivision
715-175 When choice must be made
(1) A choice under section 715-95 or 715-120 must be made within 6

715-180 Head company to notify leaving entity of choice
(1) Within one month after making a choice under section 715-95 or
715-120, or within a further period allowed by the Commissioner,
the head company must give the leaving entity written notice of the
choice.
(2) If the choice is to have a *loss denial pool of the leaving entity
created at the leaving time, the notice must also specify the pool’s
*loss denial balance at that time.

715-185 Leaving entity may choose to cancel loss denial pool by
reducing adjustable values of assets in the pool
(1) Within 6 months after a *loss denial pool is created under
section 715-110 or 715-135, or within a further period allowed by
the Commissioner, the leaving entity may choose to be treated as if
the *head company had instead made:
(a) the first choice under section 715-100 or 715-125; or
(b) the second choice under section 715-105 or 715-130;
as specified by the leaving entity in its choice.
(2) If the leaving entity makes a choice under subsection (1):
(a) the *loss denial pool ceases to exist just after the leaving
time; and
(b) at the leaving time, the *adjustable value of each *CGT asset
in the pool is reduced to what it would have been at that time
if the head company had instead made the choice specified
by the leaving entity in its choice.
(3) The choice by the leaving entity does not affect how
subsection 715-135(4) applies to the *head company.
Note:

This means that the head company’s loss denial pool still ceases to
exist.

ownership or control of loss company).
Note:

One consequence of this is that the head company is the only member
of a consolidated group that can have an alteration time and be subject
to reductions or other consequences under Subdivision 165-CD. The
head company is treated as owning all CGT assets owned by group
members, and as making relevant losses.

Another consequence is for working out who has a relevant equity
interest or relevant debt interest in a company that has an alteration
time at which it is a loss company but not a member of a consolidated
group. Interests in the loss company that are owned by subsidiary
members of the group are treated as being owned by the head
company.

(2) This section is not intended to limit the effect that
subsection 701-1(1) and section 701-5 have apart from this section.

715-225 Working out adjusted unrealised loss using individual asset
method
(1) For the purposes of:
(a) using the *individual asset method to work out whether the
*head company of a *consolidated group has an adjusted
unrealised loss under section 165-115U at an *alteration time;
or
(b) working out under section 165-115W whether the head
company of a consolidated group has a trading stock
decrease at an alteration time;
step 1 of the method statement in subsection 165-115U(1), or step
2 of the method statement in subsection 165-115W(1), does not
apply to an amount that was counted in respect of a *CGT asset at
an earlier time if:
(c) at the time (the joining time) when an entity became a
*subsidiary member of the group, the asset became an asset
of the head company because of subsection 701-1(1) (Single
entity rule); and
(d) the earlier time is an *alteration time that happened in respect
of the entity before the joining time;
unless the entity is a chosen transitional entity under Division 701
of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997.
Note:

If the joining entity is a chosen transitional entity, section 701-15 of
the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 prevents:

of this Act from applying to the assets of the joining entity in relation

If the joining entity is not a chosen transitional entity, it is assumed
that the process of resetting the tax costs of its assets will bring their
tax costs into closer alignment to their market values, and so remove
the need to consider unrealised losses on those assets that existed
before the joining time.

(2) This section has effect despite section 701-5 (Entry history rule).

715-230 No reductions or other consequences for interests subject to
loss cancellation under Subdivision 715-H
If section 715-610 reduces a loss that would otherwise be *realised
for income tax purposes by a *realisation event that happens to an
interest in, or a debt owed by, a company, sections 165-115ZA and
165-115ZB do not apply (and are taken never to have applied) to
the interest or debt, in relation to an *alteration time that happened
for the company during the ownership period referred to in
subsection 715-610(2).
Note 1:

Section 715-610 is about cancelling a loss on a realisation event for
certain kinds of interests in a member of a consolidated group.

Note 2:

Sections 165-115ZA and 165-115ZB are about the consequences that
an alteration time for a loss company has for relevant equity interests
and relevant debt interests in the company.

If a trust ceases to be a subsidiary member of a consolidated group:
see section 715-270.

715-245 If ownership or control of leaving entity has altered since
head company’s last alteration time or formation of

(1) This section applies if the leaving time would be an *alteration time
for the leaving entity if:
(a) the reference time under subsection 165-115L(2) or
165-115M(2) were:
(i) if at least one alteration time has occurred in relation to
the *head company of the *consolidated group since the
formation time and before the leaving time—the time
just after the most recent such alteration time; or
(ii) otherwise—the formation time; and
(b) the additional assumptions in section 715-290 were made.
(2) The leaving time is an alteration time for the leaving entity.
Note:

One consequence of this is that the reference time for working out the
leaving entity’s next alteration time is the time just after the leaving
time.

(3) The leaving entity is a loss company at that *alteration time if, and
only if, it has an *adjusted unrealised loss at that time. If so, that
adjusted unrealised loss is the leaving entity’s overall loss at that
time.
Note 1:

Subsection (4) affects how the leaving entity works out its adjusted
unrealised loss at the leaving time in some cases.

If the leaving entity is a loss company at the leaving time,

Section 715-265
(a) no *alteration time has occurred in relation to the *head
company of the *consolidated group since the formation time
and before the leaving time; and
(b) the leaving time is not an *alteration time for the leaving
entity under subsection 715-245(2).
(2) The leaving entity’s first *alteration time after the leaving time is
determined:
(a) on the basis that the reference time under
subsection 165-115L(2) or 165-115M(2) is the time just after
the formation time; and
(b) making the additional assumptions in section 715-290.
(3) If the leaving entity uses the *individual asset method of working
out its *adjusted unrealised loss at that first *alteration time, then
for the purposes of:
(a) step 1 of the method statement in subsection 165-115U(1);
and
(b) the method statement in subsection 165-115W(1);
the leaving entity is taken to have had no earlier alteration time.

715-265 Head company does not have relevant equity or debt
interest in a loss company if widely held top company
does not have such an interest
(1) For the purposes of Subdivision 165-CD, treat the *head company
of a *consolidated group as not having a relevant equity interest in
a *loss company at a particular time if:
(a) the head company is an *eligible tier-1 company of a *top
company at that time; and
(b) the top company is a *widely held company at that time; and
(c) because of subsections 165-115X(2A), (2B) and (2C), the top
company does not have a relevant equity interest under
section 165-115X in the loss company at that time.

subsection 165-115X(2C) has the effect that the *top company has
the relevant equity interest mentioned in that paragraph.
(3) For the purposes of Subdivision 165-CD, treat the *head company
of a *consolidated group as not having a relevant debt interest in a
*loss company at a particular time if:
(a) the head company is an *eligible tier-1 company of a *top
company at that time; and
(b) the top company is a *widely held company at that time; and
(c) because of subsections 165-115Y(3A), (3B) and (3C), the top
company does not have a relevant debt interest under
section 165-115Y in the loss company at that time.

How Subdivision 165-CD applies to leaving entity that is a trust
715-270 Subdivision 165-CD applies
(1) At and after the time (the leaving time) when a trust ceases to be a
*subsidiary member of a *consolidated group, Subdivision 165-CD
(about reductions after alterations in ownership or control of loss
company) applies to the trust on the basis set out in this section.
(2) The trust is taken to be a company.
(3) The leaving time is the only alteration time in respect of the trust.
(4) The trust is a loss company at that time if, and only if, it has an
*adjusted unrealised loss at that time. If so, that adjusted unrealised
loss is its overall loss at that time.
(5) If the trust is a *loss company at the leaving time and the *head
company has a relevant equity interest under section 165-115X in
the leaving entity at the leaving time, the head company must
choose whether subsection (6) or (7) of this section has effect for
the purposes of applying, to each *membership interest in the trust,
in relation to the time just before the leaving time, whichever of
these provisions is appropriate:
(a) subsection 701-55(3) (about trading stock);

out the *reduced cost base of a *membership interest that was
*acquired on or after 20 September 1985;
(c) subsection 701-55(6) (about revenue assets).
Note:

Section 701-55 is about setting the tax cost of an asset.

(5A) For the purposes of subsection (5), in determining whether the
*head company has the relevant equity interest, disregard the
operation of subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) in applying
subsections 165-115X(2C) and 165-115X(4).
(6) If the *head company chooses this subsection, the interest’s *tax
cost setting amount (apart from this section) just before the leaving
time is reduced to nil.
(7) If the *head company chooses this subsection, the interest’s *tax
cost setting amount (apart from this section) just before the leaving
time is reduced by the adjustment amount under
section 165-115ZB, which is calculated on the basis that:
(a) just before the leaving time:
(i) all the *membership interests in the leaving entity
constituted a single relevant equity interest under
section 165-115X that the *head company had in the
leaving entity; and
(ii) each of those interests was an equity under
section 165-115X that the *head company had in the
leaving entity; and
(b) the adjustment amount is worked out and applied in
accordance with subsection 165-115ZB(6), but disregarding
the paragraphs of that subsection except paragraphs
165-115ZB(6)(a) and (d).
(8) The *head company’s choice must be made within 6 months after
the leaving time, or within a further period allowed by the
Commissioner.

Key terminology
715-310 What is a 170-D deferred loss, and when it revives
(1) A *capital loss, deduction, or partner’s share of a deduction, that
section 170-270 (about transactions within linked groups) requires
to be disregarded is a 170-D deferred loss made:
(a) by the company that paragraph 170-255(1)(a) refers to as the
originating company; and
(b) at the time of the event that paragraph refers to as the deferral
event; and
(c) on the *CGT asset *acquired by the other entity referred to in
that paragraph.
(2) The *170-D deferred loss revives at the time when section 170-275
(as applying in relation to the deferral event) treats the originating
company as having made a *capital loss, or having become entitled
to a deduction, in respect of that asset.

Deferred loss on 165-CC tagged asset
715-355 Head company’s own deferred losses at formation time
(1) This section applies if, at the time (the formation time) when a
*consolidated group comes into existence, the *head company has
(otherwise than because of section 701-5 (Entry history rule)) a
*170-D deferred loss that:
(a) it made on a *CGT asset that is a *165-CC tagged asset of the
head company because of paragraph 165-115A(1A)(b)
(which covers CGT assets on which it has 170-D deferred
losses); and
(b) has not *revived.

Section 715-360
(2) If a *loss denial pool of the *head company is created under
section 715-60 at the formation time, each *170-D deferred loss of
that kind that the head company has at that time is added to the loss
denial pool at that time.
(3) Otherwise, a loss denial pool of the *head company is created at
the formation time if:
(a) the formation time is not a *changeover time for the head
company; and
(b) the head company’s *final RUNL just before the formation
time (as reduced by any reductions under section 715-50 or
715-55) was greater than nil; and
(c) the head company does not satisfy the *business continuity
test for:
(i) the period (the business continuity test period)
consisting of the head company’s *trial year; and
(ii) the time (the test time) just before the *changeover time.
Note:

Paragraph (3)(b) has the effect that if the head company has 165-CC
tagged assets that are affected by section 715-50 or 715-55 (because
they are membership interests in, or accounting liabilities owed by,
another group member), those sections are applied before this section.

(4) When it is created because of subsection (3), the pool consists of
each *170-D deferred loss covered by subsection (2), and its loss
denial balance is equal to the *final RUNL referred to in
paragraph (3)(b).
Note:

The pool is distinct from any other loss denial pool of the head
company, for example, one created at the formation time under
section 715-360.

715-360 Deferred losses brought in by subsidiary member
(1) This section applies if, just before the time (the membership time)
when a company (the deferred loss company) becomes a

deferred loss that:
(a) it made on a *CGT asset that is a *165-CC tagged asset of the

(2) If a *loss denial pool of the *head company is created under
subsection 715-70(2) because of the deferred loss company
becoming a *subsidiary member of the group, each *170-D
deferred loss of that kind that the deferred loss company had just
before the membership time is added to the loss denial pool at that
time.
(3) Otherwise, a loss denial pool of the *head company is created at
the membership time if:
(a) the membership time is not a *changeover time for the head
company; and
(b) the deferred loss company’s *final RUNL just before the
membership time (as reduced by any reductions under
section 715-50 or 715-55) was greater than nil; and
(c) the deferred loss company does not satisfy the *business
continuity test for:
(i) the period (the business continuity test period)
consisting of the deferred loss company’s *trial year;
and
(ii) the time (the test time) just before the *changeover time.
Note 1:

The 170-D deferred losses become those of the head company at the
formation time because of section 701-5 (Entry history rule).

Note 2:

Paragraph (3)(b) has the effect that if the deferred loss company has
other 165-CC tagged assets affected by section 715-50 or 715-55
(because the membership time is when the group comes into
existence, and the other 165-CC tagged assets are membership
interests in, or accounting liabilities owed by, another group member),
those sections are applied before this section.

(4) When it is created because of subsection (3), the pool consists of
each 170-D deferred loss covered by subsection (2), and its loss
denial balance is equal to the *final RUNL referred to in
paragraph (3)(b).

Section 715-365
Note:

The pool is distinct from any other loss denial pool of the head
company, for example, one created under this section because another
entity becomes a subsidiary member of the group at the membership
time.

715-365 How loss denial balance is applied when 170-D deferred loss
revives
(1) If a *170-D deferred loss on a *CGT asset is in a *loss denial pool
of an entity when the loss *revives, the *capital loss or deduction
that section 170-275 would, apart from this section, treat the entity
as having made or become entitled to at that time in respect of the
asset is reduced by the lesser of:
(a) the amount of the capital loss or deduction; and
(b) the pool’s *loss denial balance (as reduced by any previous
reductions under section 715-130, subsection 715-160(1) or
this subsection);
and the loss denial balance is reduced by the same amount.
(2) Subsection (1) applies to *170-D deferred losses in the order in
which they *revive. If 2 or more revive at the same time, it applies
to them in whichever order the entity determines.
(3) Subsection (1) reduces a *loss denial balance before
section 715-130 does, unless the *realisation event happens after
the leaving time referred to in that section.

715-410 Extension of single entity rule and entry history rule
(1) Subsection 701-1(1) (Single entity rule) and section 701-5 (Entry
history rule) also have effect for all the purposes of Part 3-95
(Value shifting).
Note:

One consequence of this for the operation of Division 727 (about
indirect value shifting affecting interests in companies and trusts, and
arising from non-arm’s length dealings) is that economic benefits
provided by or to a subsidiary member of a consolidated group are
treated as provided by or to the head company of the group. As a
result:
•
the head company is the only group member that can be a losing
entity or gaining entity for an indirect value shift; and
•
economic benefits provided by one group member to another are
treated as provided by the head company to itself, and so have no
relevance to Division 727.
Another consequence is that the head company is treated as owning all
interests owned by group members in a losing entity or gaining entity
that is not a group member.

(2) This section is not intended to limit the effect that
subsection 701-1(1) and section 701-5 have apart from this section.

Objects
(2) The main objects of this section are:
(a) to override section 701-40 (Exit history rule) and let the

by the entity starts to have effect.
Overriding the exit history rule
(3) For the entity core purposes set out in section 701-1 (Single entity
rule) relating to income years ending after the leaving time, ignore
a choice (however described) made by the *head company of the
*consolidated group under the choice provision or the absence of
such a choice.
Fresh choice by the entity
(4) The entity may make a choice (however described) under the
provision if the question whether the entity has made such a choice
is relevant to working out the entity’s liability (if any) for income
tax, or loss (if any) of a particular *sort, calculated by reference to
an income year ending after the leaving time.
Extension of time for fresh choice by the entity
(5) If there is a time limit (apart from this subsection) on the entity
making such a choice, the entity has until the later of these times to

(6) If the entity makes a choice because of this section, the choice
starts to have effect:
(a) at the leaving time; or
(b) if the choice relates (explicitly or implicitly) to one or more
whole income years—for the income year in which the

there is an inconsistency because either:
(a) both of these conditions are met:
(i) a choice (however described) under a provision (the

Section 715-705
(ii) such a choice by the head company had effect just
before the leaving time.
Note:

An election by the entity or head company under the choice provision
is an example of a choice under that provision (even though the
provision does not call the election a choice) because the entity or
company has chosen to make the election.

Object
(2) The main objects of this section are:
(a) to displace section 701-40 (Exit history rule), so far as it
relates to the inconsistency; and
(b) to allow the entity to make a choice (however described)
under the choice provision with effect after the leaving time.
Displacing the exit history rule
(3) For the entity core purposes set out in section 701-1 (Single entity
rule) relating to income years ending after the leaving time, ignore
a choice (however described) made by the *head company of the
*consolidated group under the choice provision or the absence of
such a choice.
(4) However, if the choice provision is section 148 of the Income Tax
Assessment Act 1936 (Reinsurance with non-residents):
(a) subsection (3) of this section does not apply in relation to
reinsurance under contracts made before the leaving time
(but does apply in relation to reinsurance under contracts
made at or after that time); and
(b) that section applies, for the entity core purposes relating to
income years ending after the leaving time, in relation to
reinsurance under a contract made before the leaving time:
(i) as if the entity had made an election under that section,
if the *head company of the *consolidated group made,
or was treated as having made, such an election that was
relevant to working out that company’s liability (if any)
for income tax, or that company’s *tax loss (if any), for
an income year in connection with the contract; or

head company had not made, and was not treated as
having made, such an election that was relevant to
working out that company’s liability (if any) for income
tax, or that company’s tax loss (if any), for an income
year in connection with the contract.
Note:

In some cases, subsection 715-665(4) treats the head company of a
consolidated group as having made an election under section 148 of
the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 in relation to reinsurance under
contracts made before an entity becomes a member of the group.

Fresh choice by the entity
(5) The entity may make a choice (however described) under the
choice provision if the question whether the entity has made such a
choice is relevant to working out the entity’s liability (if any) for
income tax, or loss (if any) of a particular *sort, calculated by
reference to an income year ending after the leaving time.
Extension of time for fresh choice by the entity
(6) If there is a time limit (apart from this subsection) on the entity
making such a choice, the entity has until the later of these times to
make the choice:
(a) the last time it may make the choice under the choice
provision (apart from this section);
(b) the end of 90 days after the leaving time or, if the
Commissioner allows a later time for the purposes of this
paragraph, that later time.
Start of effect of choice
(7) If the entity makes a choice because of this section, the choice
starts to have effect:
(a) at the leaving time; or
(b) if the choice relates (explicitly or implicitly) to one or more
whole income years—for the income year in which the
leaving time occurs.

(1) This section has effect if:
(a) an entity becomes a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated
group at a time (the joining time); and
(b) the entity’s *ordinary income and *statutory income were not
(to any extent) assessable income just before the joining time.

1936 and Division 58 of this Act have effect as if the entity’s
*ordinary income or *statutory income had become to some extent
assessable income just before the joining time.
Note 1:

Those Divisions deal with entities whose ordinary income and
statutory income were previously exempt from income tax.

Note 2:

The operation of Division 58 just before the joining time can affect the
basis on which the tax cost is set for a depreciating asset that becomes
an asset of the head company of the consolidated group at the joining
time because of section 701-1 (the single entity rule). That Division
provides the basis for working out under Division 40 the asset’s
adjustable value. This is the entity’s terminating value for the asset,
which in turn can affect the tax cost setting amount for the asset under
sections 705-40, 705-45 and 705-47.

716-15 Assessable income spread over 2 or more income years
(1) This section applies if, apart from this Part, a provision of this Act
would spread an amount (the original amount) over 2 or more
income years (whether or not because of a choice) by including
part of the original amount in the same entity’s assessable income
for each of those income years.
Head company’s assessable income
(2) If:
(a) for some but not all of an income year, an entity is a
*subsidiary member of a *consolidated group; and
(b) a part of the original amount:
(i) would have been included in the assessable income of
the *head company of the group for that income year if
the entity had been a subsidiary member of the group
throughout that income year; but
(ii) would have been included in the entity’s assessable
income for that income year if throughout that income
year the entity had not been a subsidiary member of any
*consolidated group;
the head company’s assessable income for that income year
includes a proportion of that part.

Section 716-15
Note 1:

Examples of when paragraph (2)(b) could be satisfied are:
•
the head company is the entity referred to in subsection (1), but
its connection with the original amount passes to the entity when
the entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the group (see
section 701-40 (Exit history rule));
•
the entity is the entity referred to in subsection (1) but joins a
consolidated group part way through the income year, so that its
connection with the original amount passes to the head company
of the group (see section 701-5 (Entry history rule)).

Note 2:

If the entity is a subsidiary member of the group throughout the
income year, the part of the original amount will be included in the
head company’s assessable income for the income year, either:
•
because the head company is the entity referred to in
subsection (1); or
•
because of section 701-1 (Single entity rule); or
•
because of section 701-5 (Entry history rule).

(3) The proportion is worked out by multiplying that part of the
original amount by:
• the number of days that are in both the income year and the
*spreading period, and on which the entity was a
*subsidiary member of the group;
divided by:
• the number of days that are in both the income year and the
spreading period.
Entity’s assessable income for a non-membership period
(4) If:
(a) for some but not all of an income year, an entity is a
*subsidiary member of a *consolidated group; and
(b) a part of the original amount would have been included in the
entity’s assessable income for that income year if throughout
that income year the entity had not been a subsidiary member
of any *consolidated group;
the assessable income of the entity for a part of the income year
that is a non-membership period for the purposes of section 701-30
includes a proportion of that part.

Section 716-25
Note 1:

Section 701-30 is about working out an entity’s tax position for a
period when it is not a subsidiary member of any consolidated group.

Note 2:

If throughout the income year the entity is not a subsidiary member of
any consolidated group, this section does not affect the part of the
original amount that is assessable income of the entity for the income
year either:
•
because the entity is the entity referred to in subsection (1); or
•
because of section 701-40 (Exit history rule).

(5) The proportion is worked out by multiplying that part of the
original amount by:
• the number of days that are in both the non-membership
period and the *spreading period;
divided by:
• the number of days that are in both the income year and the
spreading period.
Spreading period
(6) The spreading period for the original amount is the period by
reference to which the respective parts of the original amount that,
apart from this Part, would be included in an entity’s assessable
income for the 2 or more income years are worked out.

716-25 Deductions spread over 2 or more income years
(1) This section applies if, apart from this Part, a provision of this Act
would spread an amount (the original amount) over 2 or more
income years (whether or not because of a choice) by entitling the
same entity to deduct part of the original amount for each of those
income years.
(2) However, this section does not apply if the deductions would be for
the decline in value of a *depreciating asset.
Note:

Such deductions arise under Division 40 (Capital allowances) and
Division 328 (Small business entities).

Head company’s deduction
(3) If for some but not all of an income year an entity is a *subsidiary
member of a *consolidated group, and:
(a) the *head company of the group could have deducted for that
income year a part of the original amount if the entity had
been a subsidiary member of the group throughout that

the head company can deduct for that income year a proportion of
that part.
Note 1:

Examples of when paragraphs (3)(a) and (b) could be satisfied are set
out in note 1 to subsection 716-15(2).

Note 2:

If the entity is a subsidiary member of the group throughout the

year, either:
•
because the head company is the entity referred to in
subsection (1) of this section; or
•
because of section 701-1 (Single entity rule); or
•
because of section 701-5 (Entry history rule).

(4) The proportion is worked out by multiplying that part of the

Section 716-330

Assets in joining entity’s low-value pool
716-330 Head company’s deductions for decline in value of assets in
joining entity’s low-value pool
(1) This section modifies the operation of sections 40-430, 40-435,
40-440, 40-445, 701-10 and 701-60 and Division 705 for the head
company core purposes mentioned in section 701-1 if:
(a) an entity (the joining entity) becomes a *subsidiary member
of a *consolidated group at a time (the joining time); and
(b) there are one or more *depreciating assets (the previous pool
assets) that:
(i) were allocated to the joining entity’s low-value pool;
and
(ii) become assets of the *head company of the group at the
joining time because section 701-1 applies to the joining
entity; and
(c) none of the previous pool assets was an asset to which
Division 58 applied to affect the joining entity’s deductions
relating to the asset.
Note 1:

Sections 40-430, 40-435 and 40-440 are relevant to allocating
depreciating assets to a low-value pool and to working out the decline
in value of assets allocated to a low-value pool. Section 40-445 affects
the closing pool balance, and may give rise to assessable income, if a
balancing adjustment event happens to such an asset.

Note 2:

Section 701-10 provides that, for each asset the joining entity has at
the joining time, the asset’s tax cost is set at the joining time at the
asset’s tax cost setting amount, which is defined by section 701-60 as
the amount worked out under Division 705.

Note 3:

Division 58 is about capital allowances for depreciating assets
previously owned by an exempt entity.

Objects

(b) to reduce compliance costs by providing that the *tax cost is
set for all the previous pool assets in one operation, rather
than individually for each such asset.
Time of allocation of assets to head company’s low-value pool
(3) Sections 40-430, 40-435, 40-440 and 40-445 operate as if the *head
company of the *consolidated group allocated the previous pool
assets to a low-value pool for the income year that includes the
joining time. Section 701-5 has effect subject to this subsection.
Note 1:

Under section 40-435, the head company must make a reasonable
estimate of the taxable use percentage for each asset.

Note 2:

This subsection affects the percentages and amounts to be taken into
account for working out under section 40-440 the decline in value of
assets in the pool and the closing pool balance.

Allocating other low-cost assets to head company’s low-value pool
(4) Subsection 40-430(1) operates as if the previous pool assets were
*low-cost assets.
Note:

This has the effect that the head company must allocate to the
low-value pool each low-cost asset it starts to hold in the income year
that includes the joining time or a later income year, whether or not
the head company starts to hold the asset because of section 701-1.

If joining time was in first day of joining entity’s income year
(5) If the joining time was in the first day of the joining entity’s
income year, section 40-440 operates as if:
(a) all the previous pool assets were *low-value assets; and
(b) the sum of the previous pool assets’ *opening adjustable
values for the income year that includes the joining time
equalled the *tax cost setting amount for the hypothetical
asset worked out on the basis described in subsections (7),
(8) and (9) of this section.

If joining time was not in first day of joining entity’s income year
(6) If the joining time was not in the first day of the joining entity’s
income year, section 40-440 operates as if:
(a) all the previous pool assets were *low-cost assets; and
(b) the sum of the previous pool assets’ *costs equalled the total
of:
(i) the *tax cost setting amount for the hypothetical asset
worked out on the basis described in subsections (7), (8)
and (9) of this section; and
(ii) the expenditure (if any) that was incurred after the
joining time (but in the income year that includes that
time) and included in the second element of the costs
(ignoring this paragraph) of the previous pool assets.
Tax cost is set for assets collectively not individually
(7) Sections 701-10 and 701-60 and Division 705 operate as if all the
previous pool assets formed a single *depreciating asset (the
hypothetical asset), and were not separate assets.

Entity leaving group with asset allocated to head company’s
low-value pool
716-335 Entity leaving group with asset allocated to head company’s
low-value pool
(1) This section sets out rules affecting the *head company of a
*consolidated group and an entity (the leaving entity) that ceases to
be a *subsidiary member of the group at a time (the leaving time)
in an income year (the leaving year), if:
(a) a *depreciating asset becomes an asset of the leaving entity at
the leaving time because section 701-1 (Single entity rule)
ceases to apply to the leaving entity; and
(b) the asset was in the head company’s low-value pool.
Note:

Section 701-40 (Exit history rule) treats the asset as having been
allocated to the leaving entity’s low-value pool, with the taxable use
percentage estimated by the head company, for the income year for
which the head company allocated the asset to the head company’s
low-value pool.

Objects
(2) The main objects of this section are:
(a) to ensure that the decline in value of assets in the *head
company’s low-value pool and the decline in value of assets
in the leaving entity’s low-value pool are worked out so that:
(i) for the leaving year, the *depreciating asset is taken into
account in working out the decline in value of assets in
the head company’s low-value pool only; and
(ii) for later income years, the depreciating asset is taken
into account in working out the decline in value of
assets in the leaving entity’s low-value pool only; and
(b) to specify the *adjustable value of the depreciating asset just
before and at the leaving time.

Section 716-335
Reduced decline in value for leaving entity for leaving year
(3) The decline in value worked out for the leaving year under
subsection 40-440(1) for assets in the leaving entity’s low-value
pool is reduced by such amount as is reasonable to prevent
duplication of deductions for the leaving year in respect of the
*depreciating asset by the *head company and the leaving entity.
Reduced closing pool balance for head company’s pool for leaving
year
(4) The *closing pool balance of the *head company’s low-value pool
for the leaving year is reduced by so much of the balance as
reasonably relates to the *depreciating asset.
Cost of head company’s membership interests in leaving entity etc.
(5) Sections 701-15, 701-40 and 701-60 and Division 711 have effect
as if the *adjustable value of the *depreciating asset for the *head
company just before and at the leaving time were such amount as is
reasonable, having regard to:
(a) the reduction described in subsection (4) of this section; and
(b) the taxable use percentage estimated for the depreciating
asset by the head company under section 40-435.
Note 1:

Section 701-15 provides that, for each membership interest the head
company holds in the leaving entity, the interest’s tax cost is set just
before the leaving time at the interest’s tax cost setting amount, which
is defined by section 701-60 as the amount worked out under certain
sections of Division 711.

Note 2:

Division 711 sets the interest’s tax cost setting amount by reference to
the head company’s terminating value of the asset, which is to be
worked out under section 711-30 by reference to the adjustable value
of the asset for the head company just before the leaving time.

Note 3:

Section 701-40 has the effect that the adjustable value of the asset for
the leaving entity at the leaving time is the same as the adjustable
value of the asset for the head company then.

Section 716-340

Depreciating assets arising from expenditure in joining entity’s
software development pool
716-340 Depreciating assets arising from expenditure in joining
entity’s software development pool
(1) This section modifies the basis on which Subdivision 40-B and
sections 40-455, 701-10, 701-55 and 701-60 and Division 705
operate if:
(a) an entity (the joining entity) becomes a *subsidiary member
of a *consolidated group at a time (the joining time); and
(b) the joining entity had incurred before the joining time
expenditure that it allocated to a software development pool;
and
(c) some or all of the expenditure is reasonably related to
*in-house software that:
(i) is a *depreciating asset; and
(ii) became an asset of the *head company of the
consolidated group at the joining time because
section 701-1 (Single entity rule) applied to the joining
entity.
Note 1:

Subdivision 40-B allows deductions for the decline in value of a
depreciating asset, but only if expenditure on the asset has not been
allocated to a software development pool. Section 40-455 provides for
deduction of expenditure allocated to such a pool. Section 701-5
(Entry history rule) treats the head company as having incurred the
expenditure that was allocated to the pool.

Note 2:

Section 701-10 provides that, for each asset the joining entity has at
the joining time, the asset’s tax cost is set at the joining time at the
asset’s tax cost setting amount, which is defined by section 701-60 as
the amount worked out under Division 705, which in turn depends on
the adjustable value of the asset worked out under section 40-85.

Note 3:

Section 701-55 affects matters relevant to working out the head
company’s deductions for the decline in value of depreciating assets
that became assets of the head company at the joining time because
section 701-1 (Single entity rule) applied to the joining entity.

expenditure allocated to the pool total 100% of the expenditure
allocated to the pool.

Object
(2) The main object of this section is to ensure that:
(a) the *head company’s deductions for the *in-house software:
(i) are not worked out under section 40-455 on the basis of
section 701-5 (Entry history rule) treating the
expenditure relating to the software as being the head
company’s expenditure; and
(ii) are instead worked out under Subdivision 40-B, using
the *prime cost method with the *effective life given by
subsection 40-95(7) and taking account of the *tax cost
setting amount for the software; and
(b) the tax cost setting amount is worked out in a way that takes
account of deductions for the period before the joining time
for the expenditure reasonably related to the in-house
software.
Joining entity taken not to have incurred certain expenditure
(3) Subdivision 40-B and section 40-455 operate for the head company
core purposes mentioned in section 701-1 (Single entity rule) as if
the expenditure reasonably related to the *in-house software had
not been incurred by the joining entity.
Note 1:

This has the effects that:
(a) subsection 40-50(2) does not apply because of section 701-5
(Entry history rule) to deny the head company deductions under
Subdivision 40-B for the decline in value of the software; and
(b) the head company cannot deduct the expenditure under
section 40-455 as it operates because of section 701-5.

Note 2:

This does not prevent the head company from deducting under
section 40-455 expenditure that is not reasonably related to the
in-house software and that the head company is treated by
section 701-5 as having incurred and allocated to a software
development pool because the joining entity did.

(4) Subsection 701-55(2) operates as if the *prime cost method of
working out the decline in value of the *in-house software applied
just before the joining time.
Note:

This affects the method of working out the decline in value of the
software for the head company of the consolidated group.

Effective life of software
(5) Subdivision 40-B operates as if the *effective life of the *in-house
software were the period specified for in-house software in
subsection 40-95(7). Subsection 701-55(2) is subject to this
subsection.
Cost of in-house software
(6) Sections 701-10 and 701-60 and Division 705 (and section 40-85,
so far as it affects that Division) operate as if the *cost of the
*in-house software were the total amount of the joining entity’s
expenditure that reasonably related to the software and was
allocated to a software development pool.
Earlier decline in value of the in-house software
(7) Sections 701-10 and 701-60 and Division 705 (and section 40-85,
so far as it affects that Division) operate as if the decline in value,
and deductions for the decline in value, of the *in-house software
for a period before the joining time were the amount worked out
under subsection (8).
(8) Work out the amount by:
(a) working out, for each software development pool to which
expenditure relating to the *in-house software was allocated,
the amount of the joining entity’s deductions under
section 40-455 that reasonably relates to the software; and
(b) adding up each of those amounts if there are 2 or more such
pools.

Note:

Subsections (6), (7) and (8) can affect the working out of the tax cost
setting amount for the in-house software, by affecting the joining
entity’s terminating value for the software, which section 705-30
defines as being the adjustable value of the software just before the

(which may reduce the tax cost setting amount for the software).

(a) an entity (the leaving entity) ceases to be a *subsidiary
member of a *consolidated group at a time in an income year
(the leaving year); and
(b) under section 701-40 (Exit history rule), expenditure is taken
to have been allocated by the leaving entity to a software
development pool.
Note:

Section 701-40 treats expenditure incurred by the head company of
the consolidated group and allocated by that company to a software
development pool as having been incurred by the leaving entity and
allocated by it to a software development pool.

(2) Work out deductions of the *head company of the *consolidated

716-400 Tax cost setting and bad debts
(1) The object of this section is to clarify the effect of section 701-5
(entry history rule) and subsection 701-55(6) in relation to an asset
that may give rise to a bad debt. It achieves this object by
clarifying that certain things are taken to have happened in relation
to the asset through the operation of section 701-5 and
subsection 701-55(6).
(2) This section applies if:
(a) the tax cost of an asset was set at the time (the joining time)
an entity (the joining entity) became a subsidiary member of
a *consolidated group at the asset’s tax cost setting amount;
and
(b) the asset is a debt; and
(c) any of the following apply:
(i) the debt was included in the joining entity’s assessable
income before the joining time;
(ii) the debt was in respect of money that the joining entity
lent before the joining time in the ordinary course of a
business of lending money;
(iii) the joining entity bought the debt before the joining
time in the ordinary course of a business of lending
money; and
(d) the requirements in subsection 701-58(1) (intra-group assets)
are not satisfied in relation to the asset.
(3) To avoid doubt, in determining the extent to which the *head
company of the group can deduct an amount under section 25-35
(bad debts) in relation to the asset, section 701-5 (entry history
rule) and subsection 701-55(6) have the effect that, before the
joining time:
(a) in a case covered by subparagraph (2)(c)(i)—the head
company included an amount equal to the tax cost setting
amount in its assessable income in respect of the debt; or
(b) in a case covered by subparagraph (2)(c)(ii)—the head
company lent an amount of money in respect of the debt

Working out the cost base or reduced cost base of a pre-CGT asset after
certain roll-overs
CGT event straddling joining or leaving time

716-800 Allocating amounts to periods if head company and
subsidiary member have different income years
(1) The principles in this section apply if:
(a) an entity becomes, or stops being, a *subsidiary member of a
*consolidated group; and
(b) the entity has an income year that starts and ends at a
different time from when the income year of the *head
company of the group starts and ends.
(2) Items are to be allocated to, or apportioned among, periods
(whether consisting of all or part of an income year of the entity or
*head company):
(a) in the most appropriate way having regard to the objects of
this Part, and of particular provisions of this Part; and
(b) in particular, so as to ensure that what is in substance the
same item is recognised only once for what is in substance
the same purpose.

716-850 Grossing up threshold amounts for periods of less than 365
days
(1) Under some provisions of this Act, something that is relevant to
working out:
(a) an entity’s taxable income (if any); or
(b) the income tax (if any) payable on an entity’s taxable
income; or
(c) an entity’s loss (if any) of a particular *sort;
is determined on the basis of a comparison between an amount
worked out for an income year, or an amount *derived from 2 or
more such amounts, and another amount.
Note:

The other amount assumes an income year of 365 days.

Section 716-855
(2) This section affects how such a provision (the threshold provision)
operates for the purposes of subsection 701-30(3), which requires
each thing covered by paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) of this section to
be worked out for an entity for a non-membership period (under
section 701-30) during an income year.
Note:

A non-membership period is a period (of less than an income year)
when the entity is not a subsidiary member of any consolidated group.

(3) An amount that would otherwise be worked out for the
non-membership period, for the purposes of the comparison under
the threshold provision, is instead:
(a) to be worked out by reference to the period (the reference
period) starting at the start of the income year and ending at
the end of the non-membership period; and
(b) then to be grossed up by multiplying it by this fraction:
365
Number of days in reference period

716-855 Working out the cost base or reduced cost base of a
pre-CGT asset after certain roll-overs
If:
(a) it is necessary for the purposes of this Part to work out the
*cost base or *reduced cost base of a *pre-CGT asset owned
at a particular time; and
(b) before that time:
(i) the owner was the recipient company involved in a
roll-over under Subdivision 126-B in relation to a *CGT
event that happened in relation to the CGT asset; or
(ii) the owner was the transferee in relation to a disposal of
the CGT asset to which former section 160ZZO of the
Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 applied;
the cost base or reduced cost base is worked out as if, in applying
Subdivision 126-B or former section 160ZZO in relation to the
CGT event or the disposal, the provisions of that Subdivision or
section applying to CGT assets *acquired on or after 20 September

case with post-CGT assets.

716-860 CGT event straddling joining or leaving time
(1) This section applies if:
(a) an entity (the joining entity) becomes a subsidiary member
of a *consolidated group at a particular time (the joining
time); and
(b) disregarding the operation of subsection 701-1(1) (the single
entity rule), the joining entity held a *CGT asset at the
joining time; and
(c) taking into account the operation of subsection 701-1(1) (the
single entity rule), the *head company of the group held the
CGT asset at the joining time; and
(d) a *CGT event happened in relation to the asset at a time
before the joining time (disregarding this section), but the
circumstances that gave rise to the CGT event first existed at
a time on or after the joining time.
(2) This section also applies if:
(a) an entity (the leaving entity) ceases to be a *subsidiary
member of a *consolidated group at a particular time (the
leaving time); and
(b) taking into account the operation of subsection 701-1(1) (the
single entity rule), the *head company of the group held a
*CGT asset at the leaving time; and
(c) disregarding the operation of subsection 701-1(1) (the single
entity rule), the leaving entity held the CGT asset at the
leaving time; and
(d) a *CGT event happened in relation to the asset at a time
before the leaving time (disregarding this section), but the
circumstances that gave rise to the CGT event first existed at
a time on or after the leaving time.

Effects of change of head company
719-85 Application
Sections 719-90 to 719-95 set out the effects if:
(a) a company (the old head company) is the *head company of
a *MEC group at the end of an income year; and
(b) a different company (the new head company) is the head
company of the group at the start of the next income year (the
transition time).
Note:

This case can arise from the operation of section 719-75, which treats
an entity that is the provisional head company of the group at a certain
time in the income year as being the group’s head company at all
times in the income year when the group is in existence.
The old head company is also taken to become a subsidiary member
of the group at the transition time, and the new head company is taken
to cease being a subsidiary member at that time. Section 719-95
ensures that these results do not change the tax position of the group.

719-90 New head company treated as substituted for old head
company at all times before the transition time
(1) Everything that happened in relation to the old head company
before the transition time is taken to have happened in relation to
the new head company instead, just as if the new head company
had been the old head company at all times before the transition
time.

Note:

This section treats the new head company as having in effect assumed

old head company.

(2) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) also covers everything that,
immediately before the transition time, was taken, because of:

(b) section 701-5 (Entry history rule); or

company); or
(ca) section 719-125 (about the effects of a group conversion

(d) one or more previous applications of this section;
to have happened in relation to the old head company.
(3) Subsections (1) and (2) have effect:
(a) for the head company core purposes in relation to an income
year ending after the transition time; and
(b) for the entity core purposes in relation to an income year
ending after the transition time.
(4) Subsections (1) and (2) have effect subject to:

An example of provisions covered by paragraph (b) of this subsection
is section 707-410, which ensures that section 701-40 (Exit history

When an entity (other than an eligible tier-1 company) becomes a
subsidiary member of a MEC group, the tax cost of its assets is set
at a tax cost setting amount that is worked out in accordance with
Divisions 701 and 705 as modified by this Subdivision. Assets of
eligible tier-1 companies becoming members of a MEC group do
not have their tax cost set.

Section 719-155

Application and object
719-155 Object of this Subdivision
The object of this Subdivision is to modify the tax cost setting rules
in Divisions 701 and 705 so that they take account of the special
characteristics of *MEC groups.

Modified application of tax cost setting rules for joining
719-160 Tax cost setting rules for joining have effect with
modifications
(1A) This section applies if an entity (the MEC joining entity) becomes
a *subsidiary member of a *MEC group at a time (the MEC joining
time).
(1) This section has effect for the head company core purposes set out
in subsection 701-1(2).
General modifying rule
(2) The provisions mentioned in subsection (3) operate, for the
purposes of setting the *tax cost of an asset of the MEC joining
entity, as if each *subsidiary member of the group (including the
MEC joining entity) that is an *eligible tier-1 company at the MEC
joining time were a part of the *head company of the group, rather
than a separate entity.
Note 1:

This subsection means that references in those provisions to matters
internal to the group operate as if eligible tier-1 companies in the
group were parts of the head company of the group. For example:
(a) provisions operating if the head company holds (whether directly
or indirectly) membership interests in another entity operate even
if an eligible tier-1 company actually holds those interests; and
(b) provisions operating if the head company owns or controls
another entity operate even if one or more eligible tier-1
companies actually own or control that other entity; and
(c) provisions operating if an entity is interposed between the head
company and another entity operate even if the first entity is

actually interposed between an eligible tier-1 company and the
other entity.
Note 2:

If the MEC joining entity is an eligible tier-1 company, this subsection
means the assets of the entity do not have their tax cost reset at the
MEC joining time. This is because Subdivision 705-A (and related
provisions) reset the tax cost of assets of subsidiary members of a
group, but not assets of the head company.

(3) The provisions are:
(a) section 701-10 (about setting the tax cost of assets of an
entity joining a group); and
(b) Subdivision 705-A; and
(c) any other provision of this Act giving Subdivision 705-A a
modified effect in circumstances other than those covered by
that Subdivision.
Note:

An example of provisions covered by paragraph (c) are the provisions
of Subdivision 705-B giving Subdivision 705-A a modified effect
when a consolidated group is formed.

719-165 Trading stock value and registered emissions unit value not
set for assets of eligible tier-1 companies
(1) This section applies if an entity (the MEC joining entity) becomes
a *subsidiary member of a *MEC group at a time (the MEC joining
time).
(2) Subsection 701-35(4) (setting value of trading stock at tax-neutral
amount) does not apply to the assets of the MEC joining entity if it
is an *eligible tier-1 company at the MEC joining time.
(3) Subsection 701-35(5) (setting value of registered emissions unit at
tax-neutral amount) does not apply to the assets of the MEC
joining entity if it is an *eligible tier-1 company at the MEC joining
time.

719-170 Modified effect of subsections 705-175(1) and 705-185(1)

acquired group) become members of another MEC group, or of a

(b) other entities that were *eligible tier-1 companies of the

(2) Subsections 705-175(1) and 705-185(1) have effect as if a
*membership interest in an entity mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) of
this section were a membership interest in the *head company of
the acquired group.
Note 1:

If the acquiring group is a MEC group, and the head company of the
acquired group becomes an eligible tier-1 company of the acquiring
group, the assets of the members of the acquired group do not have
their tax cost reset at the acquisition time. This is because:
(a) section 719-160 treats an entity becoming an eligible tier-1
company of the acquiring group as if it were a part of the head
company of that group; and
(b) section 705-185 treats the subsidiary members of the acquired
group as part of the head company of the acquired group.

Note 2:

If:
(a) the acquiring group is a MEC group, but the head company of
the acquired group does not become an eligible tier-1 company
of the acquiring group; or
(b) the acquiring group is a consolidated group and the acquired
group is a MEC group;
the assets of the members of the acquired group have their tax cost
reset at the acquisition time (section 719-160 does not preclude tax
cost resetting in these cases). For the purposes of resetting the tax cost
of those assets, section 705-185 treats the subsidiary members of the
acquired group as part of the head company of the acquired group.

Maintaining the same ownership to be able to utilise loss
719-255 Special rules
(1) This section and section 719-260 have effect for the purposes of
working out whether a loss can be *utilised for an income year (the
claim year) by a company (the focal company) that made the loss
if:
(a) section 165-12 is relevant to the question whether the focal
company can utilise the loss; and
(b) the focal company is the *head company of a *MEC group at
any time in its *ownership test period for the loss (as affected
by section 707-205, if relevant).
Note:

If the focal company made the loss because of a transfer under
Subdivision 707-A, section 707-205 has the effect that the ownership
test period starts for the focal company at the time of the transfer.

Section 707-210 does not have effect
(2) Section 707-210 does not have effect for the purposes of working
out whether the focal company can *utilise the loss for the claim
year.
Note:

Section 707-210 is about whether a company can utilise a loss it made
because the loss was transferred to it under Subdivision 707-A
because the transferor met the conditions in section 165-12.

719-260 Special test for utilising a loss because a company maintains

Meeting the conditions in section 165-12
(1) The focal company is taken to meet the conditions in
section 165-12 for the claim year and the loss if and only if the
company (the test company) identified in relation to the focal
company in accordance with section 719-265 would have met
those conditions for that year on the relevant assumptions in:
(a) section 719-270 (which is about assuming the test company
made the loss for a particular income year); and

whether the test company would meet those conditions); and
(c) section 719-280 (which is about assuming that the test
company would have failed to meet those conditions in
certain circumstances).
Focal company’s failure to meet conditions in section 165-12
(2) The focal company is taken to fail to meet a condition in
section 165-12 only at:
(a) the first time the test company would have failed to meet the
condition on the relevant assumptions mentioned in
subsection (1); or
(b) the *test time described in subsection 166-5(6) for the test
company, if:
(i) Division 166 is relevant to working out whether the test
company could have *utilised the loss for the claim year
on the relevant assumptions mentioned in
paragraphs (1)(a) and (b); and
(ii) the test company is not assumed under section 719-280
to fail to meet the condition before the test time.
Note:

If the focal company is taken to fail to meet a condition in
section 165-12, the focal company will not be able to utilise the loss
for the claim year unless the focal company meets the condition in
section 165-13 by satisfying the business continuity test. That test
applies to the focal company (and not the test company).

Business continuity test for focal company under Division 166
(3) If subsection 166-5(5) affects whether the focal company can
*utilise the loss for the claim year because the focal company is a
*widely held company or an *eligible Division 166 company, or
both, during the year, subsection 166-5(6) operates as if it required
the *business continuity test to be applied to the *business the focal
company carried on just before the time described in subsection (2)
of this section.

719-270 Assumptions about the test company having made the loss
for an income year
If test company was top company for focal company’s MEC group
(1) If the test company was the *top company for a *MEC group and
the focal company is or was the *head company of that MEC
group, assume that the test company made the loss for an income
year starting at the relevant time shown in the table.
Start of income year for which test company is assumed to have made loss
If:

The relevant time is:

1 The focal company made the loss apart
from Subdivision 707-A

The start of the income year for
which the focal company made the
loss

2 The focal company made the loss
because it was transferred to the focal
company under Subdivision 707-A

The time of the transfer

Note:

Subsection (1) applies even if the test company is still the top
company for the MEC group at the end of the claim year.

indirect ownership of the test company
(1) This section sets out an assumption that must be made whenever an
event described in subsection (2) occurs:
(a) after the time assumed under section 719-270 to be the start
of the income year for which the test company made the loss;
and
(b) before the end of the claim year;

power in an entity described in the item that would affect whether
the test company would meet the conditions in section 165-12 for
the claim year and the loss.
Assumption about nothing happening to membership interests or voting power
If this event occurs:

Assume that nothing happens in relation to
membership interests or voting power in:

1 There is a *COT transfer of the
loss to the *head company of a
*MEC group (but not from a

719-285 Business continuity test and change of head company
In working out whether the *business continuity test is satisfied by
a company that, after the *test time, became the *head company of
a *MEC group that existed before that time, disregard what
happened in relation to the company before it became a *member
of the group. Section 719-90 has effect subject to this section.
Note 1:

The business continuity test is to be applied on the basis that the
company’s business at the test time was the business that
section 719-90 treats the company as having carried on at that time,
except to the extent that section 719-90 attributes to the company its
actual history before it became a member of the MEC group.

Note 2:

Section 719-90 applies if there is a change in the head company of a
MEC group, treating the later head company as if what had happened
to the earlier head company had happened to the later head company.

719-310 Adjustment of available fractions for bundles of losses
previously transferred to ongoing head company
(1) This section affects the *available fraction for each *bundle of
losses that were transferred to the ongoing head company under
Subdivision 707-A before the application event.
(2) The available fraction for the *bundle is reduced or maintained
just after the event by multiplying it by this fraction:
*Market value of the ongoing head company
just before the application event
*Market value of the ongoing head company
just after the application event
Note:

The market value of the ongoing head company at the time just before
or just after the application event will be worked out on the basis that
subsidiary members of the MEC group or consolidated group headed
by the ongoing head company at that time are part of the ongoing head
company, because of section 701-1 (the single entity rule).

(3) Item 3 of the table in subsection 707-320(2) does not apply to
affect the *available fraction for the *bundle because of:
(a) the transfer mentioned in section 719-305; or
(b) the transfer (if any) to the ongoing head company of a loss of
any *sort under Subdivision 707-A at the time of the
application event from an entity that became a *subsidiary
member of the *MEC group as a result of the event.

719-315 Further adjustment of available fractions for all bundles
(1) If, because of the application event:
(a) there is under section 719-305 an *available fraction for the
*bundle of prior group losses; and
(b) section 719-310 affects the available fraction for one or more
other bundles of losses;
this section affects the available fraction for every one of those
bundles.

(2) The available fraction (as affected by section 719-305 or 719-310)
is reduced by multiplying it by this fraction:
*Available fraction for the
*bundle of prior group losses
Sum of the *available fraction for every *bundle of
losses whose available fraction is affected by this section

(3) For the purposes of working out the fraction in subsection (2), use
the value of an *available fraction for a *bundle of losses apart
from:
(a) this section; and
(b) if item 5 of the table in subsection 707-320(2) would apply as
a result of the calculation of the available fraction in
accordance with section 719-305 or 719-310—that item.

719-320 Limit on utilising losses other than the prior group losses
(1) This section has effect for the purposes of working out how much
of the losses, other than prior group losses, in a *bundle the
ongoing head company can *utilise for the income year in which
the application event happens.
(2) For the purposes of subsection 707-310(3), the prior group losses
are to be treated as if they had not been transferred under
Subdivision 707-A, to the extent to which the ongoing head
company can *utilise them for the income year because they are
treated as being included in a *bundle whose available fraction was
1 from the start of the income year until the time of the application
event.
(3) This section is a matter that is relevant for the purposes of
paragraph 707-335(3)(f), if section 707-335 applies to the ongoing
head company’s *utilisation of the losses in the *bundle for the
income year.
Note:

That section applies to a company’s utilisation for an income year of
losses in a bundle if the losses are transferred under

(1) The ongoing head company:
(a) may choose to cancel all the losses in the *bundle of prior
group losses; and
(b) may choose to cancel all the losses in a *bundle of losses to
which section 719-310 applies.
(2) If the ongoing head company chooses to cancel all the losses in a

(3) The ongoing head company cannot *utilise for the income year in
which the application event happened more of the losses than it
would have been able to utilise under Subdivision 707-C assuming:
(a) if the losses are prior group losses:
(i) the losses were in a *bundle for the income year; and
(ii) the *available fraction for the bundle were 1 for the
period from the start of the income year until the event
happened; and
(b) in any case—the available fraction for the bundle including
the losses were 0 from the time of the event until the end of
the income year.
Note:

Section 707-335 is relevant to working out how much of the losses
could be utilised, because the value of the available fraction for the
bundle changes during the period described in that section.

(4) The ongoing head company cannot:
(a) transfer the losses to another company under Division 170
for an income year ending after the application event; or
(b) transfer the losses to another company under
Subdivision 707-A after the application event.

Maintaining the same ownership to be able to deduct bad debt
719-455 Special test for deducting a bad debt because a company
maintains the same owners
(1) This section has effect for the purposes of working out whether the
*head company of a *MEC group:
(a) can deduct a debt it writes off as bad; or
(b) could have deducted a debt as described in
subsection 709-215(2).
Note:

Whether the head company of the MEC group could have deducted a
debt as described in subsection 709-215(2) is relevant under
Subdivision 709-D to:
(a) the question whether the head company can deduct the debt it
writes off as bad, or the swap loss it makes in extinguishing the

debt as part of a debt/equity swap, after the debt was owed to an
entity while the entity was not a member of the MEC group; and
(b) the question whether an entity that was owed the debt after it was
owed to the head company can deduct the amount of the debt the
entity writes off as bad or the swap loss the entity makes in
extinguishing the debt as part of a debt/equity swap.

(2) The *head company is taken to meet the conditions in
section 165-123 (about the company maintaining the same owners)
for the *ownership test period if and only if the company (the test
company) that was the *top company for the *MEC group at the
start of the same period would have met those conditions for that
period on the assumptions in the following sections (if applicable):
(a) section 719-460 (which is about assuming that nothing
happened in relation to certain things that would affect
whether the test company would meet those conditions);
(b) section 719-465 (which is about assuming that the test
company would have failed to meet those conditions in
certain circumstances).
Note 1:

Even though subsection (2) of this section raises the issue whether the
test company meets the conditions in section 165-123, that is
determined by reference to:
(a) the ownership test period for the head company of the MEC
group; and
(b) the debt owed to the head company.

Note 2:

If this section is applying for the purposes of working out whether the
head company could have deducted a debt as described in
subsection 709-215(2), section 709-215 affects what is the ownership
test period for the purposes of section 165-123 as it applies for those
purposes.

Head company’s failure to meet conditions in section 165-123
(3) The *head company is taken to fail to meet a condition in
section 165-123 only at:
(a) the first time the test company would have failed to meet the
condition on the relevant assumptions mentioned in
subsection (2); or
(b) the *test time described in section 166-40 for the test
company, if:

Section 719-460
(i) Division 166 is relevant to working out whether the test
company met the conditions in section 165-123 on the
relevant assumption mentioned in paragraph (2)(a); and
(ii) the test company is not assumed under section 719-465
to fail to meet the condition before the test time.
Note 1:

If the head company is taken to fail to meet a condition in
section 165-123, the head company will not be able to deduct the debt
unless that company meets the condition in section 165-126 by
satisfying the business continuity test. That test applies to the head
company (and not the test company).

Note 2:

Section 719-285 may affect whether the head company satisfies the
business continuity test if there has been a change in the identity of the
head company of the group during the ownership test period.

Business continuity test for head company under Division 166
(4) If section 166-40 directly affects whether the *head company can
deduct the debt, the subsection of that section that requires the
*business continuity test to be applied to a particular *business
operates as if it required that test to be applied to the business the
head company carried on just before the time described in
subsection (3) of this section.
Note:

Section 166-40 has an indirect effect on whether the head company
can deduct the debt so far as that section affects whether the test
company meets the conditions in section 165-123 and therefore
whether the head company is taken to meet those conditions.

719-460 Assumptions about nothing happening to affect direct and
indirect ownership of the test company
(1) This section sets out an assumption that must be made whenever
there is a change in the identity of the *top company for the *MEC
group during the *ownership test period.
(2) Assume that after the change nothing happens in relation to
*membership interests or voting power in the following entities that
would affect whether the test company would meet the conditions
in section 165-123:

(ii) the company that became the top company for the MEC
group as part of the change.

719-465 Assumptions about the test company failing to meet the
conditions in section 165-123
(1) Assume that the test company fails to meet the conditions in
section 165-123 at the time an event described in subsection (2),
(3) or (4) happens after the start of the *ownership test period in
relation to:
(a) the *MEC group; or
(b) the *potential MEC group whose membership was the same
as the membership of the MEC group.
Note:

If the test company is assumed to fail to meet the conditions in
section 165-123, the head company of the MEC group is taken (under
section 719-455) to have failed to meet those conditions.

(2) One event is the *potential MEC group ceasing to exist.
(3) Another event is something happening that meets these conditions:
(a) the thing happens at a time in relation to *membership
interests in one or more of these entities:
(i) a company that was just before that time a *member of
the *MEC group and an *eligible tier-1 company of the
*top company for the MEC group;
(ii) an entity interposed between a company described in
subparagraph (i) and the company that was the top
company for the group just before that time;
(b) the thing does not cause the *potential MEC group to cease to
exist but does cause a change in the identity of the top
company for the potential MEC group.

This subsection means that, in working out tax cost setting amounts

will allocate part of the old group’s allocable cost amount for the
eligible tier-1 company to the pooled interests in the company.
However, the tax cost of the pooled interests is not set according to

Section 719-555
719-555 Application and object of this Subdivision
Application
(1) This Subdivision applies if:
(a) one or more entities hold *pooled interests (the reset
interests) in *eligible tier-1 companies that are members of a
*MEC group, just before a particular time (the trigger time);
and
(b) at the trigger time, either or both of these things happen to
one or more of those eligible tier-1 companies (the trigger
companies):
(i) the company ceases to be a member of the group;
(ii) a *CGT event happens in relation to one or more reset
interests in the company; and
*
(c) the market value of the reset interests as a whole (including
the market value of synergies arising from the combination
of those interests) just before the trigger time is more than
nil.
Object
(2) The object of this Subdivision is to set the cost of all reset interests:
(a) first, by allocating to each reset interest held in a trigger
company so much of the total cost of all reset interests held
in members of the group that the *market value of the interest
bears to the group’s market value; and
(b) then, by allocating the remainder of that total cost to all reset
interests held in other *eligible tier-1 companies, by dividing
that remainder by the number of those interests.

719-560 Pooled interests
(1) A pooled interest in an *eligible tier-1 company that is a member
of a *MEC group is a *membership interest in the eligible tier-1
company that is held by an entity that is not a member of the
group.

Note:

A membership interest in the head company of a MEC group can be a
pooled interest.

(2) Despite subsection (1), a *membership interest is not a pooled
interest if it is:
(a) a *share that is disregarded under subsection 719-30(2); or
(b) held by an entity only as a nominee of one or more other
entities each of which is a member of the group.

719-565 Setting cost of reset interests
CGT provisions—cost base
(1) If Part 3.1 or 3.3 is to apply in relation to a reset interest, the Part
applies as if the interest’s *cost base were increased or reduced so
that the cost base just before the trigger time equals the cost setting
amount worked out under section 719-570.
CGT provisions—reduced cost base
(2) If Part 3.1 or 3.3 is to apply in relation to a reset interest, the Part
applies as if the interest’s *reduced cost base were increased or
reduced so that the reduced cost base just before the trigger time
equals the cost setting amount worked out under section 719-570.
Other provisions
(3) If a provision of this Act (other than Part 3.1 or 3.3) is to apply in
relation to a reset interest, the provision applies as if the interest’s
cost just before the trigger time were equal to the cost setting
amount worked out under section 719-570.

market value of the group is:
(a) if every *eligible tier-1 company that is a member of the
group just before the trigger time is a trigger company—the
sum of the *market value (just before the trigger time) of all
reset interests in each of those companies; or
(b) otherwise—the amount mentioned in
paragraph 719-555(1)(c).
market value of the reset interest is the *market value (just before
the trigger time) of all reset interests in that trigger company, in the
same class as the interest, divided by the number of reset interests
in that company in that class.

Sections 165-115ZA and 165-115ZB are about the consequences that
an alteration time for a loss company has for relevant equity interests
and relevant debt interests in the company.

(3) In determining what is a relevant equity interest or relevant debt
interest that an entity has in the *head company just before the
*alteration time, make the assumptions in subsection 719-720(5).

719-735 Some alteration times affect only pooled interests
(1) Sections 165-115ZA and 165-115ZB do not apply in relation to an
*alteration time that happens for the *head company of a *MEC
group because of subsection 719-725(4) (trigger time for MEC
group cost setting rules: pooling cases).
(2) Instead, Subdivision 719-K applies to the *MEC group, in relation
to the trigger time, on the basis that:
(a) what would, apart from this section, be the pooled cost
amount for the purposes of the formulas in
subsections 719-570(1) and (2) is reduced by the amount of
the *head company’s overall loss under section 165-115R or
165-115S at that alteration time; but
(b) paragraph (a) of this subsection only affects the application
of those formulas because of subsection 719-570(3) (to work
out the *reduced cost base of a *membership interest).

Section 719-740
719-740 Head company does not have relevant equity or debt
interest in a loss company if widely held top company
does not have such an interest
(1) For the purposes of Subdivision 165-CD, treat the *head company
of a *MEC group as not having a relevant equity interest in a *loss
company at a particular time if:
(a) the *top company of the group is a *widely held company at
that time; and
(b) because of subsections 165-115X(2A), (2B) and (2C), the top
company does not have a relevant equity interest under
section 165-115X in the loss company at that time.
(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), disregard the operation of
subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) in determining whether
subsection 165-115X(2C) has the effect that the *top company has
the relevant equity interest mentioned in that paragraph.
(3) For the purposes of Subdivision 165-CD, treat the *head company
of a *MEC group as not having a relevant debt interest in a *loss
company at a particular time if:
(a) the *top company of the group is a *widely held company at
that time; and
(b) because of subsections 165-115Y(3A), (3B) and (3C), the top

losing entity or gaining entity for indirect value shift
(1) This section has effect for the purposes of working out the
consequences (if any) of an *indirect value shift if the *losing entity
or *gaining entity is the *head company of a *MEC group.
(Subsection (3) has effect in addition to section 727-455.)

(a) an *equity or loan interest in the *top company for the MEC
group; or
(b) an *indirect equity or loan interest in the top company.
(3) Subdivision 719-K (MEC group cost setting rules: pooling cases)
applies to the *MEC group, in relation to the first time referred to
in that Subdivision as a trigger time that happens at or after the
*IVS time, on the basis that:
(a) what would, apart from this section, be the pooled cost
amount for the purposes of the formulas in
subsections 719-570(1) and (2) is:
(i) if the *head company is the *losing entity—reduced; or
(ii) if the head company is the gaining entity—increased;
by the amount of the indirect value shift; and

719-775 Cancellation of loss
(1) This section reduces to nil a loss that would otherwise be *realised
for income tax purposes by a *realisation event that happens to an
*equity or loan interest (the realised interest) in an entity (the first
entity) when it is owned by another entity (the owner), if the
conditions in subsections (2) and (4) are met.
(2) The first condition is that, at some time during the period (the
ownership period) when the owner owned the realised interest:
(a) the first entity was a *subsidiary member of a *MEC group
(except an *eligible tier-1 company), and the owner was not a

Object
721-5 Object of this Division
The object of this Division is to secure the payment of certain tax
liabilities of the *head company of a *consolidated group where the
head company fails to meet all of those liabilities by the time they
become due and payable. Accordingly:
(a) if a relevant liability is not covered by a tax sharing
agreement—this Division provides for a process to make
certain entities that were *subsidiary members of the group
for at least part of the period to which each tax liability
relates jointly and severally liable with the head company for
those liabilities; or
(b) if a relevant liability is covered by a tax sharing agreement—
this Division:
(i) provides for a process to make each of those entities
liable for the amount determined under the agreement in
relation to the liability; but
(ii) exempts an entity from a liability determined under the
agreement if it leaves the group in certain
circumstances.

When this Division operates
721-10 When this Division operates
(1) This Division operates if:
(a) a *tax-related liability mentioned in subsection (2) (a group
liability) of the *head company of a *consolidated group was
not paid or otherwise discharged in full by the time the
liability became due and payable (the head company’s due
time); and
(b) one or more entities (the contributing members) were
*subsidiary members of the group for at least part of the
period to which the group liability relates.

(1) The following are jointly and severally liable to pay the group
liability:
(a) the *head company; and
(b) each contributing member (other than a contributing member
excluded by subsection (2)).
Note:

A group liability is a tax-related liability in relation to the head
company and each contributing member. For rights of contribution in
respect of such a liability, see subsection 265-45(2) in Schedule 1 to
the Taxation Administration Act 1953.

(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), a contributing member is
excluded by this subsection if it is, at the head company’s due time,
prohibited according to the effect of an *Australian law from
entering into any arrangement under which the entity becomes
subject to a liability referred to in subsection (1).
(3) Subsection (1) does not operate if the group liability is covered by
a tax sharing agreement (see section 721-25).
(3A) Subsection (1) is taken never to have made a particular
contributing member jointly and severally liable to pay the group
liability if:
(a) the group liability was taken never to have been covered by
the tax sharing agreement because of subsection 721-25(3);

Note:

Subsection 721-25(3) provides for this to happen if the
Commissioner did not receive a copy of the tax sharing
agreement within 14 days after the Commissioner gave the head
company the notice under that subsection.

notice of the group liability under subsection (5); and

liability in accordance with section 721-35; and
(d) the contributing member gave the Commissioner a copy of
the tax sharing agreement (that is, the relevant agreement
mentioned in paragraph 721-25(1)(a)) in the *approved form;
and
(e) if the Commissioner gave the contributing member written
notice of the group liability under subsection (5) (ignoring
subsection 721-17(2))—the contributing member gave that
copy of the agreement to the Commissioner within 14 days
after that notice was given.
(4) The joint and several liability of the contributing members under
subsection (1) arises just after the *head company’s due time.
(5) The joint and several liability of a particular contributing member
under subsection (1) becomes due and payable by the member 14
days after the Commissioner gives the member written notice
under this subsection of the liability.
Note 1:

If the Commissioner gives this notice to one contributing member, and
gives this notice to another contributing member on another day, the 2
contributing members will have different due and payable dates for
the same liability.

Note 2:

This section does not affect the time at which the group liability arose
for, or became due and payable by, the head company.

(5A) Despite subsection (5), if the group liability is *general interest
charge for a day, the joint and several liability of a particular
contributing member under subsection (1) becomes due and
payable by the member at the end of the day on which the
Commissioner gives the member written notice of the liability
under subsection (5).
(6) To the extent that the contributing members’ liability under
subsection (1) is not a liability for income tax, that liability is to be
treated as a liability for income tax for the purposes of section 254
of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.

under that subsection if the member left the group clear of the
group liability (see section 721-35).
(4) The liability of a TSA contributing member under subsection (2)
arises just after the *head company’s due time.

subsection of the liability.
Note:

This section does not affect the time at which the group liability arose
for, or became due and payable by, the head company.

Division 721 Liability for payment of tax where head company fails to pay on time

Section 721-35
(2) The Commissioner is taken to have given the TSA contributing
member written notice under subsection 721-30(5) of the amount
in relation to the *general interest charge for the subsequent day.
The notice is taken to have been given on that day.

721-35 When a TSA contributing member has left the group clear of
the group liability
For the purposes of subsection 721-30(3), a TSA contributing
member left the group clear of the group liability if:
(a) the TSA contributing member ceased to be a member of the
group at a time (the leaving time) before the *head
company’s due time; and
(b) the cessation of membership was not part of an arrangement,
a purpose of which was to prejudice the recovery by the
Commissioner of some or all of the amount of the group
liability or liabilities of that kind; and
(c) before the leaving time, the TSA contributing member had
paid to the head company:
(i) if the contribution amount for that member in relation to
the group liability could be determined before the
leaving time—an amount equal and attributable to that
amount; or
(ii) otherwise—an amount that is a reasonable estimate of,
and attributable to, that amount.

721-40 TSA liability and group liability are linked
(1) The liability of a TSA contributing member under
subsection 721-30(2) (the TSA liability) is separate and distinct for
all purposes from the group liability to which it relates (the linked
group liability). For example, the Commissioner may take
proceedings to recover the unpaid amount of the TSA liability,
proceedings to recover the unpaid amount of the linked group
liability, or both.
Note:

The TSA contributing member will not be jointly and severally liable
for the linked group liability under section 721-15 (see

subsection 721-15(3)). However, the head company of the group
remains liable for the linked group liability.

Payment or discharge of TSA liability
(2) If an amount is paid or applied at a particular time towards
discharging the TSA liability, the linked group liability is
discharged at that time to the extent of the same amount.
Payment or discharge of linked group liability
(3) If:
(a) an amount is paid or applied at a particular time towards
discharging the linked group liability; and
(b) as a result, the amount unpaid on the TSA liability at that
time (apart from this section) exceeds the amount unpaid on
the linked group liability at that time;
the TSA liability is discharged at that time to the extent of the
excess.
(4) Subsections (2) and (3) operate in relation to a liability under a
judgment (the judgment liability):
(a) if the judgment liability is for the entire amount unpaid on
the TSA liability—as if the judgment liability were the TSA
liability; and
(b) if the judgment liability is for the entire amount unpaid on
the linked group liability—as if the judgment liability were
the linked group liability.
(5) This section does not discharge a liability to a greater extent than
the amount of the liability.
