Subdivision 2-A—How to find your way around
2-1 The design
This Act is designed to help you identify accurately and quickly
the provisions that are relevant to your purpose in reading the
income tax law.
The Act contains tables, diagrams and signposts to help you
navigate your way.
You can start at Division 3 (What this Act is about) and follow the
signposts as far into the Act as you need to go. You may also
encounter signposts to several areas of the law that are relevant to
you. Each one should be followed.
Sometimes they will lead down through several levels of detail. At
each successive level, the rules are structured in a similar way.
They will often be preceded by a Guide to the rules at that level.
The rules themselves will usually deal first with the general or
most common case and then with the more particular or special
cases.

2-5 The pyramid
This Act is arranged in a way that reflects the principle of moving
from the general case to the particular.
In this respect, the conceptual structure of the Act is something like
a pyramid. The pyramid shape illustrates the way the income tax
law is organised, moving down from the central or core provisions
at the top of the pyramid, to general rules of wide application and
then to the more specialised topics.

2-25 Purposes
Two main purposes of the numbering system in this Act are:
•

To indicate the relationship between units at different
levels.
For example, the number of Part 2-15 indicates that the Part is in
Chapter 2. Similarly, the number of section 165-70 indicates that the
section is in Division 165.

•

To allow for future expansion of the Act. The main
technique here is leaving gaps between numbers.

2-30 Gaps in the numbering
There are gaps in the numbering system to allow for the insertion

This other material falls into 2 main categories.

The first is the “Guides”. A Guide consists of sections under a
heading indicating that what follows is a Guide to a particular
Subdivision, Division etc.
Guides form part of this Act but are kept separate from the
operative provisions. In interpreting an operative provision, a
Guide may only be considered for limited purposes. These are set
out in section 950-150.

2-45 Other material
The other category consists of material such as notes and
examples. These also form part of the Act. They are distinguished
by type size from the operative provisions, but are not kept
separate from them.

3-5 Annual income tax
(1) Income tax is payable for each year by each individual and
company, and by some other entities.
Note 1:

Individuals who are Australian residents, and some trustees, are also
liable to pay Medicare levy for each year. See the Medicare Levy Act
1986 and Part VIIB of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.

Note 2:

Income tax is imposed by the Income Tax Act 1986 and the other Acts
referred to in the definition of income tax in section 995-1.

(2) Most entities have to pay instalments of income tax before the
income tax they actually have to pay can be worked out.
(3) This Act answers these questions:
1. What instalments of income tax do you have to pay? When
and how do you pay them?
See Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953.

2. How do you work out how much income tax you must pay?
See Division 4, starting at section 4-1.

3. What happens if your income tax is more than the
instalments you have paid? When and how must you pay the
rest?
See Division 5 of this Act and Part 4-15 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation
Administration Act 1953.

4. What happens if your income tax is less than the instalments
you have paid? How do you get a refund?
See Division 3A of Part IIB of the Taxation Administration Act 1953.

How to work out the income tax payable on your taxable income Division 4

Section 4-10
(2) Your income tax is worked out by reference to your taxable
income for the income year. The income year is the same as the
*financial year, except in these cases:
(a) for a company, the income year is the previous financial
year;
(b) if you have an accounting period that is not the same as the
financial year, each such accounting period or, for a
company, each previous accounting period is an income year.
Note 1:

The Commissioner can allow you to adopt an accounting period
ending on a day other than 30 June. See section 18 of the Income Tax
Assessment Act 1936.

Note 2:

An accounting period ends, and a new accounting period starts, when
a partnership becomes, or ceases to be, a VCLP, an ESVCLP, an
AFOF or a VCMP. See section 18A of the Income Tax Assessment Act
1936.

(3) Work out your income tax for the *financial year as follows:


Income tax   Taxable income  Rate  – Tax offsets



Method statement
Step 1.

Work out your taxable income for the income year.
To do this, see section 4-15.

Step 2.

Work out your basic income tax liability on your taxable
income using:
(a)

the income tax rate or rates that apply to you for
the income year; and

(b)

any special provisions that apply to working out
that liability.
See the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 and section 4-25.

Division 4 How to work out the income tax payable on your taxable income

Section 4-15
Step 3.

Work out your tax offsets for the income year. A tax
offset reduces the amount of income tax you have to pay.
For the list of tax offsets, see section 13-1.

Step 4.

Subtract your *tax offsets from your basic income tax
liability. The result is how much income tax you owe for
the *financial year.

Note 1:

Division 63 explains what happens if your tax offsets exceed your
basic income tax liability. How the excess is treated depends on the
type of tax offset.

Note 2:

Section 4-11 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997
(which is about the temporary budget repair levy) may increase the
amount of income tax worked out under this section.

Income tax worked out on another basis
(4) For some entities, some or all of their income tax for the *financial
year is worked out by reference to something other than taxable
income for the income year.
See section 9-5.

4-15 How to work out your taxable income
(1) Work out your taxable income for the income year like this:
Taxable income  Assessable income – Deductions

Method statement
Step 1.

Add up all your assessable income for the income year.
To find out about your assessable income, see Division 6.

Step 2.

Add up your deductions for the income year.
To find out what you can deduct, see Division 8.

Section 5-5
5-5 When income tax is payable
Scope
(1) This section tells you when income tax you must pay for a
*financial year is due and payable.
Note:

The Commissioner may defer the time at which the income tax is due
and payable: see section 255-10 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation
Administration Act 1953.

(2) The income tax is only due and payable if the Commissioner
makes an *assessment of your income tax for the year.
(3) However, if the Commissioner does make an *assessment of your
income tax for the year, the tax may be taken to have been due and
payable at a time before your assessment was made.
Note:

This is to ensure that general interest charge begins to accrue from the
same date for all like entities. General interest charge on unpaid
income tax is calculated from when the tax is due and payable, not
from when the assessment is made: see section 5-15.

Original assessments—self-assessment entities
(4) If you are a *self-assessment entity, the income tax is due and
payable on the first day of the sixth month after the end of the
income year.
Example: If your income year is the same as the financial year, your income tax
would be due and payable on 1 December.

Original assessments—other entities
(5) If you are not a *self-assessment entity, the income tax is due and
payable 21 days after the day (the return day) on or before which
you are required to lodge your *income tax return with the
Commissioner.
Note:

For rules about income tax returns and when they are due, see Part IV
of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.

(6) However, if you lodge your return on or before the return day and
the Commissioner gives you a notice of *assessment (other than an
amended assessment) after the return day, the income tax is due
and payable 21 days after the Commissioner gives you the notice.
Amended assessments
(7) If the Commissioner amends your *assessment, any extra income
tax resulting from the amendment is due and payable 21 days after
the day on which the Commissioner gives you notice of the
amended assessment.
Note:

Shortfall interest charge may be payable, on any amount of extra
income tax payable as a result of the amended assessment, for each
day in the period that:
(a) starts at the time income tax was due and payable on your
original assessment; and
(b) ends the day before the day on which the Commissioner gives
you notice of the amended assessment.

5-10 When shortfall interest charge is payable
An amount of *shortfall interest charge that you are liable to pay is
due and payable 21 days after the day on which the Commissioner
gives you notice of the charge.
Note:

Shortfall interest charge is imposed if the Commissioner amends an
assessment and the amended assessment results in an increase in some
tax payable. For provisions about liability for shortfall interest charge,
see Division 280 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act
1953.

5-15 General interest charge payable on unpaid income tax or
shortfall interest charge
If an amount of income tax or *shortfall interest charge that you are
liable to pay remains unpaid after the time by which it is due to be
paid, you are liable to pay the *general interest charge on the
unpaid amount for each day in the period that:
(a) starts at the beginning of the day on which the amount was
due to be paid; and

6-5 Income according to ordinary concepts (ordinary income)
(1) Your assessable income includes income according to ordinary
concepts, which is called ordinary income.
Note:

Some of the provisions about assessable income listed in section 10-5
may affect the treatment of ordinary income.

(2) If you are an Australian resident, your assessable income includes
the *ordinary income you *derived directly or indirectly from all
sources, whether in or out of Australia, during the income year.
(3) If you are a foreign resident, your assessable income includes:
(a) the *ordinary income you *derived directly or indirectly from
all *Australian sources during the income year; and
(b) other *ordinary income that a provision includes in your
assessable income for the income year on some basis other
than having an *Australian source.
(4) In working out whether you have derived an amount of *ordinary
income, and (if so) when you derived it, you are taken to have
received the amount as soon as it is applied or dealt with in any
way on your behalf or as you direct.

6-10 Other assessable income (statutory income)
(1) Your assessable income also includes some amounts that are not
*ordinary income.
Note:

These are included by provisions about assessable income.
For a summary list of these provisions, see section 10-5.

Division 6 Assessable income and exempt income

Section 6-15
(2) Amounts that are not *ordinary income, but are included in your
assessable income by provisions about assessable income, are
called statutory income.
Note 1:

Although an amount is statutory income because it has been included
in assessable income under a provision of this Act, it may be made
exempt income or non-assessable non-exempt income under another
provision: see sections 6-20 and 6-23.

Note 2:

Many provisions in the summary list in section 10-5 contain rules
about ordinary income. These rules do not change its character as
ordinary income.

(3) If an amount would be *statutory income apart from the fact that
you have not received it, it becomes statutory income as soon as it
is applied or dealt with in any way on your behalf or as you direct.
(4) If you are an Australian resident, your assessable income includes
your *statutory income from all sources, whether in or out of
Australia.
(5) If you are a foreign resident, your assessable income includes:
(a) your *statutory income from all *Australian sources; and
(b) other *statutory income that a provision includes in your
assessable income on some basis other than having an
*Australian source.

6-15 What is not assessable income
(1) If an amount is not *ordinary income, and is not *statutory income,
it is not assessable income (so you do not have to pay income tax
on it).
(2) If an amount is *exempt income, it is not assessable income.
Note:

If an amount is exempt income, there are other consequences besides
it being exempt from income tax. For example:
•

the amount may be taken into account in working out the amount
of a tax loss (see section 36-10);

Note 2:

Capital gains and losses on assets used to produce some types of

(1) An amount of *ordinary income or *statutory income is exempt
income if it is made exempt from income tax by a provision of this
Act or another *Commonwealth law.
For summary lists of provisions about exempt income,
see sections 11-5 and 11-15.

(2) *Ordinary income is also exempt income to the extent that this Act
excludes it (expressly or by implication) from being assessable
income.
(3) By contrast, an amount of *statutory income is exempt income only
if it is made exempt from income tax by a provision of this Act
outside this Division or another *Commonwealth law.
(4) If an amount of *ordinary income or *statutory income is
*non-assessable non-exempt income, it is not exempt income.
Note:

An amount of non-assessable non-exempt income is not taken into
account in working out the amount of a tax loss.

An amount of *ordinary income or *statutory income is
non-assessable non-exempt income if a provision of this Act or of
another *Commonwealth law states that it is not assessable income
and is not *exempt income.
Note:

Capital gains and losses on assets used to produce some types of
non-assessable non-exempt income are disregarded (see
section 118-12).

For a summary list of provisions about non-assessable non-exempt income, see
Subdivision 11-B.

6-25 Relationships among various rules about ordinary income
(1) Sometimes more than one rule includes an amount in your
assessable income:
•

the same amount may be *ordinary income and may also
be included in your assessable income by one or more
provisions about assessable income; or

•

the same amount may be included in your assessable
income by more than one provision about assessable
income.
For a summary list of the provisions about assessable income,
see section 10-5.

However, the amount is included only once in your assessable
income for an income year, and is then not included in your
assessable income for any other income year.
(2) Unless the contrary intention appears, the provisions of this Act
(outside this Part) prevail over the rules about *ordinary income.
Note:

This Act contains some specific provisions about how far the rules
about ordinary income prevail over the other provisions of this Act.

How much is included in your assessable income?
20-35 If the expense is deductible in a single income year
(1) Your assessable income includes an *assessable recoupment of a
loss or outgoing if:
(a) you can deduct the whole of the loss or outgoing for the
*current year; or
(b) you have deducted or can deduct the whole of the loss or
outgoing for an earlier income year.
Note 1:

The operation of this section may be affected if a balancing charge has
been included in your assessable income because of a deduction for
the loss or outgoing: see section 20-45.

Note 2:

Recoupment of a loss or outgoing for which you can deduct amounts
over more than one income year is covered by section 20-40.

Note 3:

Recoupment of a loss or outgoing that is only partially deductible is
covered by section 20-50.

Total assessed not to exceed the loss or outgoing
(2) The total of all amounts that subsection (1) includes in your

Section 20-40
(a) you can deduct the whole of a loss or outgoing for the
*current year; and
(b) before the current year you received an *assessable
recoupment of the loss or outgoing;
your assessable income for the current year includes so much of
the recoupment as subsection (1) would have included if you had
instead received the recoupment at the start of the current year.

20-40 If the expense is deductible over 2 or more income years
(1) This section includes an amount in your assessable income if:
(a) you receive in the *current year an *assessable recoupment of
a loss or outgoing for which you can deduct amounts over 2
or more income years; or
(b) you received in an earlier income year an *assessable
recoupment of a loss or outgoing of that kind (unless all of
the recoupment has already been included in your assessable
income for one or more earlier income years by this section
or a *previous recoupment law).
(This section applies even if the recoupment was received before
the first of those income years.)
Note:

Recoupment of a loss or outgoing that is only partially deductible is
covered by section 20-50.

(2) Work out as follows how much is included in your assessable
income for the *current year because of one or more *assessable
recoupments of the loss or outgoing.
Note:

The method statement ensures that assessable recoupments are
included:
• only so far as they have not already been included for an
earlier income year; and
• only to the extent of your total deductions to date for the loss
or outgoing.

Section 20-40
Method statement
Step 1.

Add up all the *assessable recoupments of the loss or
outgoing that you have received (in the *current year or
earlier). The result is the total assessable recoupment.

Step 2.

Add up the amounts (if any) included in your assessable
income for earlier income years, in respect of the loss or
outgoing, by this section or a *previous recoupment law.
The result is the recoupment already assessed. (If no
amount was included, the recoupment already assessed
is nil.)

Step 3.

Subtract the recoupment already assessed from the total
assessable recoupment. The result is the unassessed
recoupment.

Step 4.

Add up each amount that you can deduct for the loss or
outgoing for the *current year, or you have deducted or
can deduct for the loss or outgoing for an earlier income
year. The result is the total deductions for the loss or
outgoing.
Note:

The total deductions may be reduced if an amount has
been included in your assessable income because of a
balancing adjustment: see section 20-45.

Step 5.

Subtract the recoupment already assessed from the total
deductions for the loss or outgoing. The result is the
outstanding deductions.

Step 6.

The unassessed recoupment is included in your
assessable income, unless it is greater than the
outstanding deductions. In that case, the amount of the
outstanding deductions is included instead.

Example: At the start of the 2002-03 income year, a company incurs $100,000 to
start to hold a depreciating asset. The company uses the prime cost
method, and the effective life is 10 years. $10,000 is deductible for the
2002-03 income year and for each of the following 9 income years
under section 40-25.

Section 20-45
In the 2002-03 income year, the company receives $20,000 as
recoupment. How much is assessable for the 2002-03 income year?
Applying the method statement:
After step 1: the total assessable recoupment is $20,000.
After step 2: the recoupment already assessed is nil.
After step 3: the unassessed recoupment is:
total assessable recoupment minus recoupment already assessed,
i.e. $20,000 minus 0 = $20,000.
After step 4: the total deductions for the loss or outgoing are $10,000.
After step 5: the outstanding deductions are:
total deductions for the loss or outgoing minus recoupment already
assessed, i.e. $10,000 minus 0 = $10,000.
After step 6: the unassessed recoupment (step 3) is greater than
outstanding deductions (step 5), so the amount of the outstanding
deductions is included in assessable income, i.e. $10,000.
Applying the method statement to the 2003-04 income year: a further
$10,000 is included in the company’s assessable income.

20-45 Effect of balancing charge
(1) This section may affect the operation of section 20-35 or 20-40 (as
appropriate) if:
(a) a balancing adjustment is required for the *current year (or
for an earlier income year) because you have deducted or can
deduct an amount for an income year for the loss or
outgoing; and
(b) an amount (the balancing charge) is included in your
assessable income for the *current year (or for the earlier
income year) because of the balancing adjustment.
To find out about balancing adjustments, see Subdivision 40-D.

Effect on section 20-35
(2) In applying section 20-35, treat each of the following as reduced by
the balancing charge:

(a) the amount of the loss or outgoing;
(b) the total of what you can deduct for the loss or outgoing for
the *current year, or have deducted or can deduct for an
earlier income year.
Effect on section 20-40
(3) In applying the method statement in subsection 20-40(2), reduce
the total deductions for the loss or outgoing by the balancing
charge.
Example: Continuing the example in subsection 20-40(2): at the start of the
2005-06 income year, the company:
• receives a further $10,000 as recoupment; and
• sells the depreciating asset for $75,000.
As a result of the sale, a balancing adjustment of $5,000 is included
under section 40-285 in the company’s assessable income for that
income year.
How much of the recoupment amount received in the 2005-06 income
year is assessable for that income year?
Applying the method statement in subsection 20-40(2):
After step 1: the total assessable recoupment is $30,000 (received
during 2002-03 and 2005-06).
After step 2: the recoupment already assessed is $20,000 (for 2002-03
and 2003-04).
After step 3: the unassessed recoupment is:
total assessable recoupment minus recoupment already assessed,
i.e. $30,000 minus $20,000 = $10,000.
After step 4: the total deductions for the loss or outgoing are $30,000
($10,000 for each of 2002-03, 2004-04 and 2004-05), reduced by
$5,000 (the amount included in assessable income for the balancing
adjustment), i.e. $25,000.
After step 5: the outstanding deductions are:
total deductions for the loss or outgoing minus recoupment already
assessed, i.e. $25,000 minus $20,000 = $5,000.

Part 2-1 Assessable income
Division 20 Amounts included to reverse the effect of past deductions

Section 20-50
After step 6: the unassessed recoupment (step 3) is greater than
outstanding deductions (step 5), so the amount of the outstanding
deductions is included in assessable income, i.e. $5,000.

20-50 If the expense is only partially deductible
(1) This section extends the operation of section 20-35 or 20-40 (as
appropriate) to a case where the total of what you can deduct under
a provision (the deduction provision) for a loss or outgoing is
limited to a proportion of the loss or outgoing.
(2) If you receive an *assessable recoupment of the loss or outgoing,
section 20-35 or 20-40 applies as if:
(a) you had incurred only that proportion of the loss or outgoing,
but could deduct the whole of that proportion under the
deduction provision; and
(b) you had received only that proportion of the recoupment.
Example: You incur expenditure of $500. A provision listed in section 20-30
entitles you to deduct 10% of the expenditure ($50) over 5 years. This
means you can deduct $10 in each of the 5 years.
You recoup $300 of the expenditure. This section treats you as
receiving only 10% of the recoupment. Therefore, $30 is dealt with by
section 20-40.

20-55 Meaning of previous recoupment law
(1) Previous recoupment law means a provision of the Income Tax
Assessment Act 1936 listed in this table.

Section 20-65
(d) the entity that incurred the loss or outgoing receives one or
more amounts as *recoupment of the loss or outgoing.
This Subdivision (except this section and section 20-65) applies as
if you had incurred the loss or outgoing and had also received the
*recoupment.

20-65 If 2 or more entities can deduct amounts for the loss or
outgoing
(1) Special rules apply if:
(a) an entity (the first entity) incurs a loss or outgoing; and
(b) 2 or more entities (the deducting entities, which may include
the first entity) have deducted or can deduct amounts for the
loss or outgoing (whether for the same income year or for
different income years); and
(c) the first entity receives one or more amounts as *recoupment
of the loss or outgoing.
(2) This Subdivision (except this section and section 20-60) applies as
if the first entity and the deducting entities together constituted a
single entity (the notional entity) that had:
(a) incurred the loss or outgoing; and
(b) received the amount or amounts as *recoupment; and
(c) included in its assessable income any amount included in the
assessable income of any of the deducting entities under a
*previous recoupment law or this Subdivision (except this
section).
(3) If because of subsection (2) the notional entity’s assessable income
for an income year (the assessment year) would include an amount
under this Subdivision (the assessable amount), the amount
reverses in the assessment year the deductions for the loss or
outgoing, in accordance with the rules in subsection (5).

20-100 What this Subdivision is about
This Subdivision reverses the effect of deductions for lease
payments for a car leased to you (or to your associate), but only if
you make a profit by disposing of the car after acquiring it from the
lessor. The smallest of these amounts is included in your assessable
income:
•

Part 2-1 Assessable income
Division 20 Amounts included to reverse the effect of past deductions

Section 20-110

The usual case
20-110 Disposal of a leased car for profit
(1) Your assessable income includes the *profit you make on disposing
of a *car if:
(a) the car was designed mainly for carrying passengers; and
(b) the car was leased to you and has been leased to no-one else;
and
(c) you or another entity can deduct for the income year any of
the lease payments paid or payable by you, or have deducted
or can deduct any of them for an earlier income year, under
this Act; and
(d) you acquired the car from the lessor.
Note 1:

Even if subsection (1) does not apply, an amount may still be included
in your assessable income:
• under section 20-125 (which deals with more complicated
cases that may involve your associate); or
• if you disposed of an interest in a car (rather than the car
itself): see section 20-160.

Note 2:

In some cases you do not include an amount in your assessable
income:
• if there has been an earlier disposal of the car for market value:
see section 20-135; or
• if you inherited the car: see section 20-145; or
• if the car was let on hire in the circumstances set out in
section 20-155.

(2) However, the amount included cannot exceed the smaller of these
limits:
(a) the total lease payments for the lease that you or another
entity have deducted or can deduct under this Act for an
income year;
(b) the amount of *notional depreciation for the lease period.

Section 20-115
Note 1:

If, because of more than one lease of the car, there is more than one
way to work out the amount to be included, you only include the
largest amount: see section 20-130.

Note 2:

In some cases you reduce the amount to be included:
• if there has been an earlier disposal of the car, or of an interest
in it: see section 20-140; or
• if another provision requires you to include an amount because
of the disposal: see section 20-150.

(3) You increase those limits if you have previously leased the *car
from the same lessor, or from an *associate of that lessor.
You increase the first limit by the total lease payments for each
previous lease of that kind that you or another entity have deducted
or can deduct under this Act for an income year.
You increase the second limit by the amount of *notional
depreciation for the period of each previous lease of that kind.

20-115 Working out the profit on the disposal
(1) The profit on the disposal is the amount by which the
*consideration receivable for the disposal exceeds:
•

the amount it cost you to acquire the *car;

plus:
•

any capital expenditure you incurred on the car after
acquiring it.

(2) The consideration receivable is worked out using this table:
Consideration receivable for the disposal of the car
Item

In this situation:

the consideration receivable is:

1

you sell the *car for an amount
specific to it

the proceeds of the sale, less the
expenses of the sale

4

you sell the *car and another entity

the amount by which the cost of the
other car is reduced by the sale, plus
any other consideration you receive

5

you dispose of the *car to an insurer
because it is lost or destroyed

the amount or value received or
receivable under the insurance policy

(3) However, if the disposal of the *car is a *taxable supply, the
consideration receivable does not include an amount equal to the
*GST payable on the supply.

20-120 Meaning of notional depreciation
This is how to work out the notional depreciation for a lease
period:
Method statement
Step 1. Compare:
• the *car’s *cost to the lessor for the purposes of
Subdivision 40-C (which is about working out the cost
of *depreciating assets);
with:
• the car’s *termination value for the purposes of
section 40-300 when the lessor disposed of it.
Step 2.

If the car’s cost exceeds the car’s termination value,
multiply the excess by:

Section 20-125
•

the number of days in the lease period;

divided by:
• the number of days the lessor owned the car.
Step 3.

The result is the notional depreciation for the lease
period.

Step 4.

If the car’s cost does not exceed the car’s termination
value, the notional depreciation for the lease period is
zero.

Note 1:

The notional depreciation for the lease period represents:
• the amount you could have deducted for the car’s decline in
value if, instead of leasing it, you had owned it and used it
solely for the purpose of producing assessable income for
that period;
adjusted by:
• the balancing adjustment you would have made if you had
disposed of the car at the end of that period.

Note 2:

The car’s cost to the lessor is worked out differently if the lessor
acquired it in the 1996-97 income year or an earlier income year: see
section 20-105 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997.

Note 3:

The car’s termination value is worked out differently if the lessor
disposed of it in the 1996-97 income year or an earlier income year:
see section 20-110 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act
1997.

20-125 Disposal of a leased car for profit
(1) Your assessable income includes the *profit you make on disposing
of a *car if:
(a) section 20-110 does not include an amount in your assessable
income because of the disposal; and
(b) the car was designed mainly for carrying passengers; and
(c) the car was leased to you or your *associate; and

lessee, or have deducted or can deduct any of them for an
earlier income year, under this Act; and
(e) either:
(i) you, your associate, or entities including you or your
associate, acquired the car from the lessor; or
(ii) another entity acquired the car from the lessor under an
*arrangement that enabled you or your associate to
acquire the car.
Note 1:

Even if subsection (1) does not apply, an amount may be included in
your assessable income if you disposed of an interest in a car (rather
than the car itself): see section 20-160.

Note 2:

In some cases you do not include an amount in your assessable
income:
• if there has been an earlier disposal of the car for market value:

(ii) any capital expenditure that entity, or any of those
entities, incurred on the car after that acquisition and
before you acquired it.
Note 1:

If, because of more than one lease of the car, there is more than one
way to work out the amount to be included, you only include the
largest amount: see section 20-130.

Note 2:

In some cases you reduce the amount to be included:
• if there has been an earlier disposal of the car, or of an interest
in it: see section 20-140; or
• if another provision requires you to include an amount because
of the disposal: see section 20-150.

Example: Your associate leases a car for 5 years and then acquires it from the
lessor for $4,000. Your associate sells it to you for $3,000. You sell it
for $10,000.
Your profit is $10,000 (the consideration receivable) less $3,000 (the
car’s cost to you) = $7,000.
The first 2 limits on the amount to be included in your assessable
income are $9,000 (total deductible lease payments for the lease) and
$8,000 (notional depreciation for the lease period).
Since your associate acquired the car from the lessor, the third limit is
$10,000 (the consideration receivable by you) less $4,000 (the car’s
cost to the associate) = $6,000.
The amount you include in your assessable income cannot exceed the
smallest of the limits. So, you do not include your profit of $7,000.
Instead, you include $6,000 (the smallest of the limits).

(3) You increase the first 2 limits if you, or your associate, have
previously leased the *car from the same lessor, or from an
associate of that lessor.
You increase the first limit by the total lease payments for each
previous lease of that kind that you, your *associate or another
entity have deducted or can deduct under this Act for an income
year.

Examples: Your associate leases a car for 5 years and then acquires it. Your
associate disposes of it to you and section 20-110 includes $500 in
your associate’s assessable income.
You later dispose of the car.
In working out the amount to include in your assessable income for
your disposal, you can reduce each limit in subsection 20-125(2) by
$500 because the disposal by your associate occurred after the lease
period began.
Contrast this case:
You lease a car for 5 years and then acquire it. You dispose of it to

the disposal is reduced by any amount that another provision of
this Act (except sections 40-285 and 40-370) requires you to
include in your assessable income because of the disposal.

sections 40-285 and 40-370 are about including an amount after
making a balancing adjustment on the disposal of a car.

Division 25 Some amounts you can deduct

Section 25-5
No deduction for certain expenditure
(2) You cannot deduct under subsection (1):
(a) *tax; or
(b) an amount withheld or payable under Part 2-5 or Part 2-10 in
Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953; or
(c) expenditure for *borrowing money (including payments of
interest) to pay an amount covered by paragraph (a) or (b); or
(d) expenditure for a matter relating to the commission (or
possible commission) of an offence against an *Australian
law or a *foreign law; or
(e) a fee or commission for advice about the operation of a
*Commonwealth law relating to taxation, unless that advice
is provided by a *recognised tax adviser.
No deduction for expenditure excluded from general deductions
(3) You cannot deduct expenditure under subsection (1) to the extent
that a provision of this Act (except section 8-1) expressly prevents
or limits your deducting it under section 8-1 (about general
deductions). It does not matter whether the provision specifically
refers to section 8-1.
No deduction for capital expenditure
(4) You cannot deduct capital expenditure under subsection (1).
However, for this purpose, expenditure is not capital expenditure
merely because the *tax affairs or *Australian GloBE tax affairs
concerned relate to matters of a capital nature.
Example: Under this section, you can deduct expenditure you incur in applying
for a private ruling on whether you can depreciate an item of property.

Use of property taken to be for income producing purpose
(5) Under some provisions of this Act it is important to decide whether
you used property for the *purpose of producing assessable

income. For provisions of that kind, your use of property is taken
to be for that purpose insofar as you use the property for:
(a) managing your *tax affairs; or
(b) complying with an obligation imposed on you by a
*Commonwealth law, insofar as that obligation relates to the
*tax affairs of another entity.
Example: You buy a computer to prepare your tax returns. The expenditure you
incur in buying the computer is capital expenditure and cannot be
deducted under this section.
However, to the extent that you use the computer in preparing your
income tax return, you will be able to deduct the decline in value of
your computer under Division 40. That is because, under this
subsection, the computer is property that you are taken to use for the
purpose of producing assessable income.

(6) If another provision of this Act expressly provides that a particular
use of property is not taken to be for the *purpose of producing
assessable income, that provision overrides subsection (5).
Expenditure by trustee of deceased estate
(8) If:
(a) after you die, the trustee of your deceased estate incurs
expenditure; and
(b) had you incurred the expenditure before you died, you could
have deducted it under subsection (1);
for the purposes of assessing the trustee for the income year in
which you died, the expenditure is a deduction under that
subsection.

(2) If you have used, or will use, the leased property only partly for
that purpose, you can deduct the expenditure to the extent that you
have used, or will use, the leased property for that purpose.

25-25 Borrowing expenses
(1) You can deduct expenditure you incur for *borrowing money, to
the extent that you use the money for the *purpose of producing
assessable income. In most cases the deduction is spread over the
*period of the loan.
For the cases where the deduction is not spread, see subsection (6).
Note:

Your deductions under this section may be reduced if any of your
commercial debts have been forgiven in the income year: see
Subdivision 245-E.

Income year when money used solely for the purpose of producing
assessable income
(2) You can deduct for an income year the maximum amount worked
out under subsection (4) if you use the *borrowed money during
that income year solely for the *purpose of producing assessable
income.
Example: In 1997-98 you borrow $100,000 and incur expenditure of $1,500 for
the borrowing. You use the money to buy a house. Throughout
1998-99 you rent the house to a tenant. You can deduct for the
expenditure for 1998-99 the maximum amount worked out under
subsection (4).

Income year when borrowed money used partly for that purpose
(3) If you use the money only partly for that purpose during that
income year, you can deduct the proportion of that maximum
amount that is appropriate having regard to the extent that you used
the *borrowed money for that purpose.

Step 1.

Step 2.

Work out the remaining expenditure as follows:
•

For the income year in which the *period of the

•

For a later income year, it is the amount of the
expenditure reduced by the maximum amount that
you can deduct for the expenditure for each earlier
income year.

Work out the remaining loan period as follows:
•

For the income year in which the *period of the
loan begins, it is the period of the loan (as
determined at the end of the income year).

•

For a later income year, it is the period from the
start of the income year until the end of the period
of the loan (as determined at the end of the income
year).

Step 3.

Divide the remaining expenditure by the number of days
in the remaining loan period.

Some amounts you can deduct Division 25

Section 25-25
Example: To continue the example in subsection (2): suppose the original period
of the loan is 4 years starting on 1 September 1997. What is the
maximum amount you can deduct for the expenditure for 1997-98?
Applying the method statement:
After Step 1: the remaining expenditure is $1,500 (the amount of the
expenditure).
After Step 2: the remaining loan period is 4 years from 1 September
1997 (1,461 days).
After Step 3: the result is $1,500 divided by 1,461 = $1.03.
After Step 4: the result is $1.03 multiplied by 302 days = $310.06.
Suppose you repay the loan early, on 31 December 1998. What is the
maximum amount you can deduct for the expenditure for 1998-99?
Applying the method statement:
After Step 1: the remaining expenditure is $1,500 (the amount of the
expenditure) reduced by $310.06 (the maximum amount you can
deduct for 1997-98) = $1,189.94.
After Step 2: the remaining loan period is the period from 1 July 1998
to 31 December 1998 (183 days).
After Step 3: the result is $1,189.94 divided by 183 days = $6.50.
After Step 4: the result is $6.50 multiplied by 183 days = $1,189.94.

Meaning of period of the loan
(5) The period of the loan is the shortest of these periods:
(a) the period of the loan as specified in the original loan
contract;
(b) the period starting on the first day on which the money was
borrowed and ending on the day the loan is repaid;
(c) 5 years starting on the first day on which the money was
borrowed.

Section 25-65
25-65 Local government election expenses
(1) You can deduct expenditure you incur in contesting an election for
membership of a *local governing body, but you cannot deduct
more than $1,000 per election. You deduct the expenditure for the
income year in which you incur it.
(2) However, you can deduct more than the $1,000 limit if:
(a) you have received an amount as *recoupment of the
expenditure; and
(b) some or all of that amount is included in your assessable
income for an income year; and
(c) the total of your deductions for the election would be less
than the $1,000 limit if you disregarded so much (the
assessed recoupment) of the expenditure as equals the
amount so included in your assessable income.
In that case:
(d) the assessed recoupment is disregarded in applying the
$1,000 limit; and
(e) the further amount that you can deduct because of
paragraph (d) is deducted for the income year referred to in
paragraph (b).
Example: Chris is elected to the Bunyip Shire Council. In the 2007-08 income
year he incurs expenditure of $1,200 in contesting the election, of
which he deducts $1,000 (the limit under subsection (1)).
In 2008-09, Chris receives $360 as an assessable recoupment of the
expenditure. $300 of that is included in his assessable income by
section 20-35 (as extended by section 20-50).
Because of the assessable recoupment, $300 of the expenditure is
disregarded under paragraph (2)(d) in applying the $1,000 limit. As a
result, Chris’s deductions are treated as being only $700, which is less
than the limit. This does not affect his original deduction for
2007-2008, but it means he can deduct the previously undeducted
$200, for 2008-09 (see paragraph (2)(e)).
This triggers a further application of section 20-35 (as extended by
section 20-50) to include the remaining $60 of the assessable

to the extent that you incur it in respect of:

concluded that you have a purpose of enabling or facilitating
*entertainment to be provided to someone else.

receipts
(1) An entity can deduct these amounts it pays for premises:
(a) rates which are annually assessed;

But only if it uses the premises:
(c) for the purpose of producing mutual receipts; or

26-10 Leave payments
(1) You cannot deduct under this Act a loss or outgoing for long
service leave, annual leave, sick leave or other leave except:
(a) an amount paid in the income year to the individual to whom
the leave relates (or, if that individual has died, to that
individual’s dependant or *legal personal representative); or
(b) an *accrued leave transfer payment that is made in the
income year.
(2) An accrued leave transfer payment is a payment that an entity
makes:
(a) in respect of an individual’s leave (some or all of which
accrued while the entity was required to make payments in
respect of the individual’s leave, or leave the individual
might take); and
(b) when the entity is no longer required (or is about to stop
being required) to make payments in respect of such leave;
and
(c) to another entity when the other entity has begun (or is about
to begin) to be required to make payments in respect of such
leave; and
(d) under (or for the purposes of facilitating the provisions of) an
*Australian law, or an award, order, determination or
industrial agreement under an *Australian law.
It does not matter whether the leave accrues to the individual as an
employee or for some other reason.
Example: Your employee goes to a new employer. You pay the new employer
$2,000 for the employee’s unused long service leave because an
industrial agreement requires you to make that payment.
Note:

An accrued leave transfer payment is included in the assessable
income of the entity to which it is made: see section 15-5.

26-47 Non-business boating activities
Object
(1) The object of this section is to improve the integrity of the taxation
system by preventing deductions from boating activities that are
not carried on as a *business being offset against other assessable
income.
Rule
(2) This Act applies to you as if so much of the amounts relating to
using or *holding boats that you could otherwise deduct for an
income year as exceeds your assessable income from using or
holding boats for that year:
(a) were not deductible for that income year; and
(b) were an amount (a quarantined amount) relating to using or
holding boats that you can deduct for the next income year.
Note:

A quarantined amount may be reduced under subsection (5) (for boat
capital gains), reduced under subsection (7) (where you deduct part of
a quarantined amount under subsection (6) for boat business profits),
reduced under subsection (8) (about exempt income) or affected by
subsection (10) (about bankruptcy).

Example: Ian does not use his boat in a business. In Year 1, Ian would be able to
claim $100,000 in deductions for the boat (but for this subsection),
including interest, depreciation and running costs. He earns only
$40,000 of income from the boat. He can only deduct $40,000. He
carries the remaining $60,000 forward to Year 2 (the quarantined
amount).
In Year 2, Ian has $95,000 of expenses and $30,000 of income for the
boat. He can deduct $30,000. The quarantined amount is now
$125,000: the quarantined amount from Year 1 plus the excess of
expenses over income from Year 2.
In Year 3, Ian has $60,000 of expenses and $150,000 of income from
the boat. The expenses from Year 3 plus the quarantined amount is
$185,000. Therefore, Ian claims a deduction of $150,000 and carries
forward $35,000 to Year 4.

Exception: business use
(3) The rule in subsection (2) does not apply to amounts that are

(b) using a boat (or holding it) mainly for letting it on hire in the
ordinary course of a *business that you carry on;

Deduction if you have boat business profits
(6) You can deduct all or part of your remaining quarantined amount

(1) You can choose only one method for all the *car expenses for the
*car for the income year. Choosing one method precludes the other
method.
(2) However, you can change your choice for the income year.
Example: You choose the “log book” method and deduct $1,000. On audit, the
Commissioner finds that your claim is too high and should be reduced
to $500. You would have been able to deduct $700 if you had chosen
the “cents per kilometre” method. This rule lets you change your
choice and deduct the $700.

(3) You can also choose different methods for the same *car for
different income years and different methods for different cars for
the same year.

Example: If the car travelled 5,085 business kilometres, you could claim for
5,000, and would lose the extra 85.

(3) Business kilometres are kilometres the *car travelled in the course
of:
(a) producing your assessable income; or
(b) your *travel between workplaces.
You calculate the number of business kilometres by making a
reasonable estimate.
(4) For the purposes of subsection (1), the Commissioner may, by
legislative instrument, determine rates of cents per kilometre for
cars for an income year.
(5) In determining a rate, the Commissioner must have regard to the
average operating costs for the cars to be covered by that rate.
Note:

Examples of operating costs include fixed costs such as registration,
insurance and depreciation, and variable costs such as fuel and
maintenance.

28-30 Capital allowances
If a *balancing adjustment event occurs for the *car, you will need
to refer to the capital allowances rules in Division 40 to find out
how using this method affects the operation of those rules. See
section 40-370 (about balancing adjustments for some cars).

Substantiation

28-90 How to calculate your deduction
(1) To use the “log book” method, you multiply the amount of each
*car expense by the *business use percentage.
The expense
(2) The expense must qualify as a deduction under some provision of
this Act outside this Division (or would qualify if, while you *held
the *car, you had used it only in producing your assessable
income). If only part of the expense would qualify, you multiply
that part by the *business use percentage.
Example: You borrow money to buy a car. You make repayments of principal
and payments of interest.
You cannot deduct the repayments of principal because they are
capital expenses.
The interest payments would be deductible in full if, throughout the
income year, you had used the car only in producing your assessable
income.
Using the “log book” method:
• if you held the car for the whole income year—multiply the
interest payments by the business use percentage;
• if you held the car for only 6 months of the income year—
multiply the interest payments for those 6 months by the
business use percentage.
To find out whether an expense qualifies as a deduction under this Act, see
Division 8 (Deductions).

The percentage
(3) The business use percentage is calculated by dividing:
• the number of *business kilometres that the *car travelled

in the period when you *held it during the income year;

period;
and expressing the result as a percentage.
(4) Business kilometres are kilometres the *car travelled in the course
of:
(a) producing your assessable income; or
(b) your *travel between workplaces.
(5) You calculate the number of business kilometres by making a
reasonable estimate. The estimate must take into account all
relevant matters, including:
(a) any log books, odometer records or other records you have;
and
(b) any variations in the pattern of use of the *car; and
(c) any changes in the number of cars you used in the course of
producing your assessable income.
(6) You hold a *car while you own it, or it is leased to you, for use in
the course of producing your assessable income, even if it is also
used for some other purpose.

In certain circumstances the lessee of a luxury car is taken to be its

28-110 Steps for keeping a log book
There are 3 steps you need to follow in keeping a log book:
• identify an income year for which to keep a log book;
• choose a period of at least 12 weeks for the log book to

cover;
• record journeys made in the car during the log book period

in the course of producing your assessable income.

Operative provisions
28-115 Income years for which you need to keep a log book
(1) You need to keep a log book for the first income year for which
you use this method for the *car.
(2) Having kept a log book for one income year, you don’t need to
keep a new one for the next 4 or more income years unless
subsection (3) or (4) requires it. If you haven’t kept a new log book
for 4 income years in a row, you must keep one for the next
income year.
Example: If you keep a log book in 1997-98, you would need to keep the next
one in 2002-2003, unless subsection (3) or (4) requires one sooner.

Section 28-120
(3) You must keep a log book for an income year if the Commissioner
sends you a notice before the year directing you to keep a log book
for the *car for that year.
(4) You must keep a log book for an income year if, during that year,
you get one or more additional *cars for which you want to use the
“log book” method for that year.
(5) When you replace one *car with another, you might have a period
when you *hold both the new car and the old car, or a period when
you no longer *hold the old car but do not yet hold the new car. In
both these cases, you are treated for the purposes of subsection (4)
as if you held the one car continuously.
(6) You may choose to keep a log book for an income year even if you
don’t need to; for example, because you want to establish a higher
*business use percentage.

28-120 Choosing the 12 week period for a log book
(1) The log book must cover a continuous period of at least 12 weeks
throughout which you *held the *car. If you hold the car for less
than 12 weeks, the period must be the entire period for which you
held the car.
(2) The period may overlap the start or end of the income year, so long
as it includes part of the year.
(3) If you want to use the “log book” method for 2 or more *cars for
the same income year, the log books for those cars must cover
periods that are concurrent.

28-125 How to keep a log book
(1) It is in your interests to record in the log book any journey made in
the *car during the log book period in the course of producing your
assessable income. If a journey is not recorded, the log book will
indicate a lower *business use percentage than is actually the case.

(2) A journey is recorded by making in the log book an entry
specifying:
(a) the day the journey began and the day it ended;
(b) the *car’s odometer readings at the start and end of the
journey;
(c) how many kilometres the car travelled on the journey;
(d) why the journey was made.
The record must be made at the end of the journey or as soon as
possible afterwards.
(3) If 2 or more journeys in a row are made in the *car on the same day
in the course of producing your assessable income, they can be
recorded as a single journey.
(4) The following must be entered in the log book:
(a) when the log book period begins and ends;
(b) the *car’s odometer readings at the start and the end of the
period;
(c) the total number of kilometres that the car travelled during
the period;
(d) the number of kilometres that the car travelled, in the course
of producing your assessable income, on journeys recorded
in the log book;
(e) the number of kilometres referred to in paragraph (d),
expressed as a percentage of the total number referred to in
paragraph (c).
Each of the entries must be made at or as soon as possible after the
start or end of the period, as appropriate.
(5) Each entry in the log book must be in English.

28-130 Replacing one car with another
(1) For the purposes of using the “log book” method, you may
nominate one *car as having replaced another car with effect from
a day specified in the nomination.
(2) After the nomination takes effect, the replacement *car is treated as
the original car, and the original car is treated as a different car.
This means that you do not need to repeat for the replacement car
the steps you have already taken for the original car under this
Subdivision.
(3) You must record the nomination in writing before you lodge your
*income tax return for the income year in which the nomination
takes effect. However, the Commissioner may allow you to do it
later.
(4) You must retain the nomination document until the end of the
period for which you must retain the last log book that you began
to keep for the original *car before the day of effect of the
nomination.
(5) Section 28-150 (which is about retaining log books) applies to the
nomination document in the same way as it applies to that last log
book.

affected by the nomination.
(2) Each entry under subsection (1) must be in English and must be
made at or as soon as possible after the start or end of the period, or
the end of the specified day, as appropriate.

28-150 Retaining the log book for the retention period
(1) You must retain the log book:
(a) first, until the end of the latest income year for which you
rely on the log book to support your calculation of the
*business use percentage for the *car; and
(b) then for another 5 years.
The period for which you must retain the log book is called the
retention period.
(2) The 5 years start on the due day for lodging your *income tax
return for that latest income year. If you lodge your return later, the
5 years start on the day you lodge it.
(3) However, the *retention period is extended if, when the 5 years
end, you are involved in a dispute with the Commissioner that
relates to a deduction worked out using a *business use percentage
that you are relying on the log book to support. See
section 900-170.
(4) If you do not retain the log book for the *retention period, you
cannot deduct any amount worked out using a *business use
percentage that you are relying on the log book to support. If you
have already deducted such an amount, your assessment may be
amended to disallow the deduction.
(5) For the purposes of the rules about retaining and producing records
of expenses (see Subdivision 900-G), the log book is treated as a

effects of failing to substantiate (see Subdivision 900-H), not doing
something required by this Division is treated in the same way as
not doing something necessary to follow the rules in Division 900.

28-155 Retaining odometer records
(1) You must retain your odometer records relating to the period when
you *held the *car in the income year.
(2) If you keep a log book for the income year, you must retain the
odometer records for the same period as the log book, and
section 28-150 applies to them in the same way as it applies to the
log book.
(3) If you don’t keep a log book for the income year, you must retain
the odometer records for the same period as written evidence of a
*car expense for the *car for the income year, and section 900-75
applies to them in the same way as it applies to written evidence of
an expense.

Note:

Subdivision 30-DA deals with the deductibility of contributions and
gifts to political parties, independent candidates and members.

(2) Subdivision 30-A contains a table of all the gifts and contributions
that you can deduct. You need to look at the table to see whether
the type of gift or contribution you are making is covered by it.
(3) In some cases, the table sends you off to Subdivision 30-B. It has a
number of tables that list particular funds, authorities or institutions
that deductible gifts can be made to.
(4) In other cases, the table sends you off to Subdivision 30-C. It
contains rules that apply to particular gifts of property.
(4AA) Subdivision 30-BA provides for the Commissioner to endorse as a
deductible gift recipient an entity that is, or operates, a fund,
authority or institution. The relevance of the Subdivision to you is
that generally you can deduct only a gift you make to a recipient
that is endorsed or named in:
(a) this Division; or
(b) regulations made for the purposes of this Division.
Note:

The fact that gifts to a recipient registered in the Australian Business
Register are deductible will be shown in the Register.

(4AB) Subdivision 30-CA sets out administrative rules which do not
directly affect whether you can deduct a gift you make. The rules
require:
(a) a receipt issued by an entity for a gift to the entity or to a
fund, authority or institution operated by the entity to show
the entity’s ABN; and
(b) the Australian Business Registrar to enter in the Australian
Business Register a statement in relation to an entity entered
in the Register if:
(i) gifts to the entity are deductible; or
(ii) gifts to a fund, authority or institution operated by the
entity are deductible.

for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(iii) or
paragraph (2)(c) of this section; and
Note:

Section 30-215
Amount you can deduct for a gift of property
Item

In this case:

The amount you can deduct is:

1

Section 30-205 (which is about the
proceeds of the sale being
assessable) applies, and you bought
the property

the amount you paid for the property,
reduced by the amount of any *input
tax credit to which you are or were
entitled for your *acquisition of the
property

2

Section 30-205 (which is about the
proceeds of the sale being
assessable) applies, and you created
or produced the property

so much of the cost of creation or
production as you would have been
able to deduct if you had sold the
property, reduced by the amount of
any *input tax credit to which you are
or were entitled for your *acquisitions
to the extent that they were made for
the purpose of creating or producing
the property

3

Neither of cases 1 and 2 applies,
and you acquired the property:
(a) less than one year before making
the gift (otherwise than by
inheriting it); or
(b) for the purpose of giving it
away; or

the lesser of the amount you paid for
the property and:
(a) if the average of the written
valuations you got fairly
represents the *GST inclusive
market value (as reduced under
subsection (4) if that subsection
applies) of the property on the day
you made the gift—that average;
or

(c) subject to an *arrangement that
the property would be given
away

(b) if it does not—the *GST inclusive
market value (as reduced under
subsection (4) if that subsection
applies) of the property on the day
you made the gift

None of cases 1 to 3 applies, and
the *GST inclusive market value (as
the average of the written valuations reduced under subsection (4) if that
you got does not fairly represent the subsection applies) of the property on
*market value of the property on the the day you made the gift
day you made the gift

Section 32-10
However, there are exceptions, which are set out in
Subdivision 32-B.
Note 1:

Under section 8-1 you can deduct a loss or outgoing that you incur for
the purpose of producing assessable income.

Note 2:

If you have used your property in providing entertainment, you may
not be able to deduct an amount for the property: see section 32-15.

Note 3:

Section 32-75 deals with arrangements to avoid the operation of this
section.

32-10 Meaning of entertainment
(1) Entertainment means:
(a) entertainment by way of food, drink or *recreation; or
(b) accommodation or travel to do with providing entertainment
by way of food, drink or *recreation.
(2) You are taken to provide entertainment even if business
discussions or transactions occur.
Note:

These are some examples of what is entertainment:
• business lunches
• social functions.
These are some examples of what is not entertainment:
• meals on business travel overnight
• theatre attendance by a critic
• a restaurant meal of a food writer.

32-15 No deduction for property used for providing entertainment
To the extent that you use property in providing *entertainment,
your use of the property is taken not to be for the *purpose of
producing assessable income if section 32-5 would stop you

providing the entertainment.

32-20 The main exception—fringe benefits
Section 32-5 does not stop you deducting a loss or outgoing to the
extent that you incur it in respect of providing *entertainment by
way of *providing a *fringe benefit.
But this exception does not apply to the extent that the taxable
value of the *fringe benefit is reduced under section 63A of the
Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986.
Note 1:

You may be able to deduct losses or outgoings that are fringe benefits
under section 51AEA, 51AEB or 51AEC of the Income Tax
Assessment Act 1936. If you do, then you cannot deduct them under
section 8-1 (about general deductions) and so this section is not
relevant.

Note 2:

There are other exceptions for a loss or outgoing you incur in
providing a benefit that would be a fringe benefit if it were not an
exempt benefit: see items 1.6 and 1.7 of the table in section 32-30.

35-1 What this Division is about
This Division prevents losses of individuals from non-commercial
business activities being offset against other assessable income in
the year the loss is incurred. The loss is deferred.
It sets out an income requirement and a series of tests to determine
whether a business activity is treated as being non-commercial.
The deferred losses may be offset in later years against profits from
the activity. They may also be offset against other income if the
income requirement and one of the other tests are satisfied, or if the
Commissioner exercises a discretion.

Operative provisions
35-5 Object
(1) The object of this Division is to improve the integrity of the
taxation system by:
(a) preventing losses from non-commercial activities that are
carried on as *businesses by individuals (alone or in
partnership) being offset against other assessable income;
and
(b) preventing pre-business capital expenditure and
post-business capital expenditure by individuals (alone or in
partnership) in relation to non-commercial activities being
deductible under section 40-880 (business related costs);
unless certain exceptions apply.
(2) This Division is not intended to apply to activities that do not
constitute carrying on a *business (for example, the receipt of
income from passive investments).

35-10 Deferral of deductions from non-commercial business
activities
(1) The rule in subsection (2) applies for an income year to each
*business activity you carried on in that year if you are an
individual, either alone or in partnership (whether or not some
other entity is a member of the partnership), unless:
(a) you satisfy subsection (2E) for that year, and one of the tests
set out in any of the following provisions is satisfied for the
business activity for that year:
(i) section 35-30 (assessable income test);
(ii) section 35-35 (profits test);
(iii) section 35-40 (real property test);

Section 35-10
(b) the Commissioner has exercised the discretion set out in
section 35-55 for the business activity for that year; or
(c) the exception in subsection (4) applies for that year.
Note:

This section covers individuals carrying on a business activity as
partners, but not individuals merely in receipt of income jointly.
Compare the definition of partnership in subsection 995-1(1).

Rules
(2) If the amounts attributable to the *business activity for that income
year that you could otherwise deduct under this Act for that year
exceed your assessable income (if any) from the business activity
for that year, or your share of it, this Act applies to you as if the
excess:
(a) were not incurred in that income year; and
(b) were an amount attributable to the activity that you can
deduct from assessable income from the activity for the next
income year in which the activity is carried on.
Note 1:

There are modifications of this rule if you have exempt income (see
section 35-15) or you become bankrupt (see section 35-20).

Note 2:

This rule does not apply if your excess is solely due to deductions
under Division 41 (see section 35-10 of the Income Tax (Transitional
Provisions) Act 1997).

Example: Jennifer has a salaried job, and she also carries on a business activity
consisting of selling lingerie.
Jennifer starts that activity on 1 July 2002, and for the 2002-03
income year, the activity produces assessable income of $8,000 and
deductions of $10,000. The activity does not pass any of the tests and
the discretion is not exercised so the $2,000 excess is carried over to
the next income year in which the activity is carried on.
For the 2003-04 income year, the activity produces assessable income
of $9,000 and deductions of $10,000 (excluding the $2,000 excess
from 2002-03). Again, no tests passed and no exercise of discretion.
$3,000 is carried over to the next income year (comprising the $1,000
excess for the current year, plus the previous year’s $2,000 excess)
when the activity is carried on.

(b) the Commissioner has exercised the discretion set out in
section 35-55 for the business activity; or
(c) the exception in subsection (4) applied;
for the income year in which the business activity ceased to be
carried on or an earlier income year.
(2B) If you are an individual, either alone or in partnership (whether or
not some other entity is a member of the partnership), you cannot
deduct an amount under section 40-880 (business related costs) for
expenditure in relation to a *business activity:
(a) you propose to carry on; or
(b) another entity proposes to carry on if the other entity is not an
individual, either alone or in partnership;
for an income year before the one in which the business activity
starts to be carried on.
(2C) This section applies to an amount that you could have deducted,
apart from paragraph (2B)(a), as if it were an amount attributable
to the *business activity that you can deduct from assessable
income from the activity for the income year in which the business
activity starts to be carried on.

(3) If you *derived *exempt income, also subtract your *net exempt
income (worked out under section 36-20).
(4) Any amount remaining is your tax loss for the income year, which
is called a loss year.
Note 1:

Some deductions are limited so that they cannot contribute to a tax
loss. See section 26-55 (Limit on certain deductions).

Note 2:

The meanings of tax loss and loss year are modified by section 36-55
for a corporate tax entity that has an amount of excess franking
offsets.

(5) For subsection (3), if you have *exempt income under
section 51-100 (about shipping), disregard 90% of so much of your
*net exempt income as directly relates to that exempt income.

36-15 How to deduct tax losses of entities other than corporate tax
entities
(1) Your *tax loss for a *loss year is deducted in a later income year as
follows if you are not a *corporate tax entity at any time during the
later income year.
Note 1:

See section 36-17 for the deduction of a tax loss of an entity that is a
corporate tax entity at any time during the later income year.

that would result in the entity having an amount of excess
franking offsets for that year.
Example: For the 2017-18 income year, Company A (which is not a base rate
entity) has:
• a tax loss of $150 from a previous income year; and
• assessable income of $200 (franked distribution of $70,
franking credit of $30 and $100 of income from other
sources); and
• no deductions; and
• no net exempt income.
The tax offset of $30 from the franking credit is not stated in
Division 67 to be subject to the refundable tax offset rules.
Company A would not have an amount of excess franking offsets for
that year if the tax loss were disregarded (see section 36-55). This is
because the tax offset of $30 is less than $60, the amount of income
tax that Company A would have to pay if it did not have the tax offset
and the tax loss. Paragraph (a) therefore does not apply.
If Company A chooses to deduct the full amount of the tax loss, it
would have an amount of excess franking offsets of $15:

$30 

  $200

 $150    

Company A therefore cannot make this choice because of
paragraph (b).

would not have an amount of excess franking offsets:

$30 

  $200

 $    

Company A therefore can choose to deduct $100 of the tax loss.

(6) The entity must state its choice under subsection (2) or (3) in its
*income tax return for the later income year.

(7) If the entity has 2 or more *tax losses, the entity is to deduct them
in the order in which the entity incurred them.

Film losses
(2) If:
(a) you pay an amount in the income year for a debt that you
incurred in an earlier income year; and
(b) you incurred the debt in the course of deriving or gaining
*assessable film income or *exempt film income; and
(c) you also incurred a *film loss covered by section 36-35 in

(3) A film loss is the *film component (if any) of a *tax loss.
(4) Your *tax loss for an income year has a film component if your
*film deductions for the year exceed the sum of:

(b) your *assessable film income for the loss year had been your
only assessable income; and
(c) your *net exempt film income for the loss year had been your

exceeds:
(b) the amount of income tax that the entity would have to pay
on its taxable income for that year if:
(i) it did not have those tax offsets; and
(ii) it did not have any tax offsets that are subject to the tax
offset carry forward rules or the refundable tax offset
rules; and
(iii) it did not have any tax offset under section 205-70;
but had all its other tax offsets.
The excess is the amount of excess franking offsets.
Note:

Division 65 sets out the tax offset carry forward rules. Division 67 sets
out which tax offsets are subject to the refundable tax offset rules.

Example: For the 2017-18 income year, Company E (which is not a base rate
entity) has:
• assessable income of $200 (franked distribution of $140 and
franking credit of $60); and
• $100 of deductions that are allowable.
The tax offset of $60 from the franking credit is not stated in
Division 67 to be subject to the refundable tax offset rules.
Disregarding the tax offset of $60 from the franking credit, the amount
of income tax that Company E would have to pay is $30:

  $140

 $60   $   

This amount is $30 less than the tax offset of $60. Company E
therefore has an amount of excess franking offsets of $30 for that
year.

How to work out the amount of the tax loss
(2) For the purposes of this Act, if:
(a) an entity has an amount of *excess franking offsets for an
income year; and
(b) the result of applying the following method statement is a
positive amount;
then:

Chapter 2 Liability rules of general application
Part 2-5 Rules about deductibility of particular kinds of amounts
Division 36 Tax losses of earlier income years

Section 36-55
(c) the entity is taken to have a *tax loss for that year equal to
that positive amount (instead of an amount of tax loss worked
out under section 36-10, 165-70, 175-35 or 701-30); and
(d) that year is taken to be a *loss year for the entity if the entity
would not otherwise have a tax loss for that year.
Method statement
Step 1.

Work out the amount (if any) that would have been the
entity’s *tax loss for that year under section 36-10,
165-70, 175-35 or 701-30 if the entity’s *net exempt
income for that year (if any) were disregarded.
Note:

See section 36-20 for the calculation of net exempt
income.

Step 2.

Divide the amount of *excess franking offsets by the
entity’s *corporate tax rate for imputation purposes for
that year.

Step 3.

Add the results of steps 1 and 2.

Step 4.

Reduce the result of step 3 by the entity’s *net exempt
income for that year (if any).
The result of this step is taken to be the entity’s *tax loss
for that year. However, if the result of this step is nil or a
negative amount, the company does not have any tax loss
for that year.

Example: Assume that company E did not derive any exempt income for the
2017-2018 income year and that it would not otherwise have any tax
loss for that year under section 36-10, 165-70, 175-35 or 701-30.
Applying the method statement, the amount of excess franking offsets
of $30 generates a tax loss of $100 for that year, which can be
deducted in a later income year under section 36-15 or 36-17.
