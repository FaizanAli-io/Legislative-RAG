A managed investment trust in relation to an income year is an
attribution managed investment trust (or AMIT) for the income
year if certain criteria are satisfied. In particular, for the trust to be
an AMIT, the interests of the members of the trust need to be
clearly defined at all times during which the trust is in existence in
the income year (see Subdivision 276-A).

Section 276-5
An AMIT for an income year is treated as a fixed trust. A member
of the AMIT in respect of the income year is treated as having a
vested and indefeasible interest in a share of the income and capital
of the AMIT throughout the income year (see Subdivision 276-B).
Amounts related to income and tax offsets of an AMIT, determined
by the trustee to be of a particular tax character, are attributed to
members, generally retaining that tax character (see
Subdivision 276-C).
Underestimates and overestimates of amounts at the trust level are
carried forward and dealt with in later years. This is done on a
character-by-character basis. An underestimate in an income year
of a particular character results in an under of that character. An
overestimate results in an over of that character. Unders and overs
arise, and are dealt with, in the income year in which they are
discovered (see Subdivision 276-F).
The trustee of an AMIT is liable to pay income tax on certain
amounts reflecting under-attribution of income or over-attribution
of tax offsets (see Subdivision 276-G).
Special rules apply to a trust that ceases to be an AMIT (see
Subdivision 276-K).

(a) an amount is included in the assessable income of a *member
of an *AMIT in respect of an income year in respect of the
member’s interest in the AMIT; and
(b) that amount is so included otherwise than because of the
operation of subsection 276-80(2).
(2) Reduce the amount included in the assessable income of the
*member as mentioned in subsection (1) to the extent (if any) that a
corresponding amount is included in the assessable income of the
member in respect of the member’s interest in the *AMIT because
of the operation of subsection 276-80(2).
(3) To avoid doubt, this section is subject to section 230-20 (financial
arrangements).

does not accord with subsections 276-210(2), (3) and (4), that
determined member component is instead the member’s *member
component of that character for the income year.
(4) For the purposes of subsection (3), in working out the member’s
*member component of that character for the income year, if the
*trust component of that character differs from the *determined
trust component of that character, treat the references in
section 276-210 to determined trust component as instead being
references to trust component.
Example: The determined trust component exceeds the trust component because
of an unintentional mistake by the trustee of the AMIT. As a result, a
member’s corresponding determined member component under
subsection (1) exceeds what it would have been if the trustee had not
made the mistake.
If the member makes a choice under subsection (2), the amount of the
determined member component will be determined according to the
amount of the trust component.

(5) The choice must:
(a) be in writing; and
(b) state the following matters:
(i) the income year to which the choice relates;
(ii) what the *member considers to be the member’s
*member component of that character for the income
year;
(iii) the reason why the member considers that the
*determined member component of that character for
the income year does not accord with

(6) The way the *member’s *income tax return is prepared is sufficient
evidence of the making of the choice.

components for the year.
Meaning of member component
(2) The *member’s member component of a character is so much of

General taxability and residence assumptions to be made
(1) Work out the amount of the *trust component of each character in
relation to the *AMIT assuming that the AMIT’s trustee:
(a) was liable to pay *tax; and
(b) was an Australian resident.
Trust components of assessable income character are net of

(2) The sum of all of the *trust components of a character relating to
assessable income of the *AMIT for the income year equals the
total assessable income of the AMIT for the income year, reduced
by all deductions of the AMIT for the year. To avoid doubt, for the
purposes of this subsection, apply subsection (1).
(3) However, if that total assessable income does not exceed those
deductions, the amount of each *trust component of a character
relating to assessable income of the *AMIT for the income year is
nil.

276-300 What this Subdivision is about
This Subdivision sets out how underestimates and overestimates of
amounts at the trust level are carried forward and dealt with in later
years. This is generally done on a character-by-character basis.
An underestimate in an income year of a particular character
results in an under of that character. An overestimate results in an
over of that character.
Unders and overs arise, and are dealt with, in the income year in
which they are discovered.

Despite section 276-345, an *AMIT does not have an *under or an
*over of a particular character for an income year (the base year)
if:
(a) assuming the Commissioner made an assessment of the *trust
component of that character on the day on which the
document stating the AMIT’s *determined trust component
of that character for the base year was created; and
(b) assuming the assessment had not been amended at the
discovery time mentioned in subsection 276-345(2) for the
under or over;
section 170 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 would prevent
the assessment from being amended to take account of the under or

Section 280-5
280-5 Overview
(1) There are 3 phases in the tax treatment of superannuation, as
follows:
(a) the contributions phase;
(b) the investment phase;
(c) the benefits phase.
(2) In the contributions phase, contributions are made to a
superannuation plan in respect of a member of the plan.
(3) In the investment phase, these contributions are invested by the
superannuation provider.
(4) In the benefits phase, these contributions, plus earnings from
investing them, are usually paid as benefits to the member when he
or she retires after reaching preservation age. In the event of death,
the benefits are usually paid to the member’s dependants.
(5) There is also a regulatory scheme outside this Act that is relevant
to the taxation treatment of superannuation. For example, other
Acts set out prudential and operating standards for superannuation
providers.

Contributions phase
280-10 Contributions phase—deductibility
Contributions that can be deducted
(1) Employers can usually deduct contributions they make in respect
of their employees. Individuals can usually deduct contributions
they make in respect of themselves to most complying
superannuation funds.
Other contributions cannot be deducted
(2) Other contributions cannot be deducted. These include
contributions made by others in respect of individuals (such as

contributions by a spouse or family member, or Government
co-contributions).

280-15 Contributions phase—limits on superannuation tax
concessions
(1) There is a limit to contributions that can be made in respect of an
individual in a year that receive favourable tax treatment.
(2) If concessional contributions exceed an indexed cap, the excess is
included in the individual’s assessable income and gives rise to a
tax offset. The individual can release the excess concessional
contributions from his or her superannuation interests. Unused cap
can be carried forward for 5 years.
(3) If non-concessional contributions exceed an indexed cap, the
individual can request the release of either:
(a) nothing; or
(b) an amount equal to the sum of that excess and 85% of the
associated earnings on that excess;
from the individual’s superannuation interests. Whether or not such
a request is made, an amount relating to those associated earnings
may be included in the individual’s assessable income and may
give rise to a tax offset.
(4) In the absence of such a request, the Commissioner may require the
relevant superannuation fund to release the amount described in
paragraph (3)(b).
Note:

This can be done under subsection 131-15(2) in Schedule 1 to the
Taxation Administration Act 1953.

(5) The individual is taxed:
(a) on any shortfall between the amount released as described in
subsection (3) or (4) and the excess referred to in
subsection (3); or
(b) on that excess, if the individual requested that nothing be
released from the individual’s superannuation interests.

Note:

This can be done under subsection 131-15(3) in Schedule 1 to the
Taxation Administration Act 1953.

Investment phase
280-20 Investment phase
(1) Contributions that can be deducted are assessable income of the
superannuation provider. Contributions that cannot be deducted are
not assessable income of the superannuation provider. (There are
some exceptions.)
(2) Earnings on the investment of amounts in a superannuation plan
are assessable income of the superannuation provider.
(3) The superannuation provider’s taxable income is generally taxed at
the concessional rate of 15%.
(4) However, superannuation providers pay no tax on earnings from
the assets that support the payment of benefits in the form of
income streams, once the income streams have commenced.

Benefits phase
280-25 Benefits phase—different types of superannuation benefit
Superannuation benefits can be drawn down as lump sums, income
streams (such as pensions or annuities), or combinations of both.
Different tax treatment may apply depending on whether a lump
sum or income stream is paid.

280-30 Benefits phase—taxation varies with age of recipient and
type of benefit
(1) The taxation of superannuation benefits depends primarily on the
age of the member.

Division 280 Guide to the superannuation provisions

Section 280-35
(2) If the member is aged 60 or over, superannuation benefits (both
lump sums and income streams) are tax free if the benefits have
already been subject to tax in the fund (that is, where the benefits
comprise a taxed element). This covers the great majority of
superannuation members.
(3) Where a superannuation benefit contains an amount that has not
been subject to tax in the fund (an untaxed element), this element is
subject to tax for those aged 60 or over, though at concessional
rates. This is relevant generally to those people (for example,
public servants), who are members of a superannuation fund
established by the Australian Government or a state government.
(4) If the member is less than 60, superannuation benefits may receive
concessional taxation treatment, though the treatment is less
concessional than for those aged 60 and over.
(5) Superannuation benefits may also include a “tax free component”;
this component of the benefit is always paid tax free.
(6) Additional tax concessions may apply when superannuation
benefits are paid after a member’s death.

280-35 Benefits phase—roll-overs
A member can “roll over” their superannuation benefits from one
complying superannuation plan to another, or between different
interests in the same plan. This is usually done to keep the benefits
invested in the superannuation system, or to convert a lump sum to
a superannuation income stream. No tax is generally payable until
the benefits are finally drawn down.

291-1 What this Division is about
There is a cap on the amount of superannuation contributions that
may receive concessional tax treatment for an individual in a
financial year.
You can carry forward unused concessional contributions cap from
the previous 5 financial years and use it to increase your cap in a
later financial year (unless your total superannuation balance
equals or exceeds $500,000).
Superannuation contributions that exceed your concessional
contributions cap are included in your assessable income for the
corresponding income year.
A tax offset compensates for the tax that generally applies to the
contributions in the superannuation fund.
Note:

Part 2-35 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953
contains rules about releasing the excess concessional contributions
from superannuation.

(a) an amount equal to the excess concessional contributions is
included in your assessable income for your corresponding
income year; and
(b) you are entitled to a *tax offset for that income year equal to

(a) for the 2017-2018 financial year—$25,000; or
(b) for the 2018-2019 financial year or a later financial year—the
amount worked out by indexing annually the amount
mentioned in paragraph (a).

(i) there is not already a contribution covered under this section,
and made to a complying superannuation plan in respect of
you, from an earlier choice you made in relation to the
disposal of:
(i) another ownership interest in the dwelling that was not a
related spousal interest to the old interest; or
(ii) an ownership interest in another dwelling.
Note 1:

Subparagraph (i)(i) does not prevent another contribution, made for
you from the capital proceeds from the disposal of the same interest,
from also being a contribution covered under this section.

Note 2:

That subparagraph also does not prevent another contribution, made
for you from the capital proceeds from the disposal of a related
spousal interest, from being a contribution covered under this section.

10-year ownership condition
(2) The condition in this subsection is met for the *disposal of the old
interest if either or both of the following paragraphs applies:

(i) the old interest was held by you, your *spouse or your
former spouse; or
(ii) an *ownership interest in the land on which the
*dwelling is situated was held by you, your spouse or
your former spouse;
(b) if subsection 118-147(1):
(i) applies because the old interest was a substitute property
interest (within the meaning of that subsection) for an
old dwelling referred to in paragraph 118-147(1)(a); or
(ii) would have applied as described in subparagraph (i) if
paragraph 118-147(1)(a) were modified to refer to a
dwelling (the old dwelling) that was your main
residence;
you, your spouse or your former spouse *acquired an
ownership interest in that old dwelling at least 10 years

(a) for the 2017-2018 *financial year—$1,600,000; or
(b) for the 2018-2019 financial year or a later financial year—the
amount worked out by indexing annually the amount
mentioned in paragraph (a).
Note:

Subdivision 960-M shows how to index amounts. However, annual
indexation does not necessarily increase the amount of the cap: see
section 960-285.

294-40 Proportionally indexed transfer balance cap
(1) This section applies to increase your transfer balance cap for a
*financial year (other than the financial year in which you first start
to have a *transfer balance account) if:

indexation for the financial year; and
(b) at no time before the start of that financial year has the
*transfer balance in your transfer balance account at the end
of a day exceeded your transfer balance cap.
(2) Your transfer balance cap is increased for the *financial year by
the amount worked out using the following formula:
Unused cap percentage ´ Indexation increase

where:
indexation increase means the amount by which the *general
transfer balance cap for the *financial year increased as a result of
indexation.
unused cap percentage is worked out by:
(a) identifying the highest *transfer balance in your *transfer
balance account at the end of any day up to the end of the
previous *financial year; and
(b) identifying the day on which the transfer balance account had
that transfer balance at the end of the day, or, if your transfer
balance account had that transfer balance at the end of more
than one day, the earliest of those days; and

(2) In working out whether there is a superannuation income stream
at a time:
(a) have regard only to facts and circumstances that exist at that
time; and
(b) assume a requirement will be met, to the extent (if any) that:
(i) the requirement arises under a provision of the *taxation
law or under any rules or standards under which a
benefit is, or is purported to be, provided; and
(ii) meeting the requirement is a condition for there to be a

facts and circumstances that exist at that time, whether
or not the requirement has been met.

(1) Despite section 294-35, your transfer balance cap on a day is the
sum of the cap increments that have arisen under this Subdivision
on and before that day.
Note:

Your transfer balance cap is not worked out on a financial year basis
and it is not indexed.

(2) However, if there are one or more *superannuation income streams
of which you are, on that day, a *retirement phase recipient but not
a *child recipient, your transfer balance cap on that day is the sum
of:
(a) the sum of the cap increments that have arisen under this

(b) your transfer balance cap for the *financial year in which the
day falls, worked out disregarding:
(i) any cap increments that arise under this Subdivision;
and
(ii) any *transfer balance credits or *transfer balance debits
that have arisen in your *transfer balance account in
respect of superannuation income streams of which you
are a child recipient.
Note:

Paragraph (b) is the transfer balance cap you would have if you were

295-10 How to work out the tax payable by superannuation entities
(1) Use this method for *superannuation funds, *approved deposit
funds and *pooled superannuation trusts:
Method statement
Step 1.

For a *superannuation fund, work out the *no-TFN
contributions income. Apply the applicable rates as set
out in the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to that income.

Step 2.

Work out the entity’s assessable income and deductions
taking account of the special rules in this Division. The
special rules modify some provisions of this Act. They
also include amounts in assessable income, allow
deductions and exempt amounts from income tax.

Step 3.

Work out the entity’s taxable income as if its trustee:
(a)
(b)

were an Australian resident (except where
paragraph (b) applies); or
for a *non-complying superannuation fund that is a
superannuation fund for the income
year—were not an Australian resident.
*foreign

Step 4.

For a *complying superannuation entity, work out the
*low tax component and *non-arm’s length component of
the entity’s taxable income.

Step 5.

Apply the applicable rates as set out in the Income Tax
Rates Act 1986 to:
(a)

if step 4 applies to the entity—the components
worked out under that step; or

or, for a *superannuation fund, from the sum of the
fund’s step 1 and step 5 amounts.

(2) Use this method for *RSA providers:
Method statement
Step 1.

Work out the entity’s *no-TFN contributions income.
Apply the applicable rates as set out in the Income Tax
Rates Act 1986 to that income.

Step 2.

Work out the entity’s assessable income and deductions
taking account of the special rules in this Division.

Step 3.

Work out the *RSA component and *standard component
of the entity’s taxable income.

Step 5.

Apply the applicable rates as set out in the Income Tax
Rates Act 1986 to the components. The *RSA component
is taxed at a concessional rate.

Step 6.

Subtract the entity’s *tax offsets from the sum of the
entity’s step 1 and step 5 amounts.

applies from the liability to pay tax unless it does so expressly.

295-25 Assessments on basis of anticipated SIS Act notice
(1) The Commissioner may make an assessment for a fund or trust that
is not a *complying superannuation entity for the income year as if
it were such an entity if the Commissioner considers it likely that a
notice will be given under section 40 of the Superannuation
Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 having the effect that it will
become such an entity.
(2) However, the grounds for making an assessment under
subsection (1) are taken never to have existed if:
(a) the Commissioner becomes satisfied that the notice will not
be given; or
(b) *APRA does not receive the documents referred to in
subsection 36(1) of the Superannuation Industry
(Supervision) Act 1993 about the fund or trust before the end
of 12 months after the assessment is made.

295-30 Effect of revocation etc. of SIS Act notices
This Division has effect as if a notice given under section 342 of
the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (about
pre-1 July 88 funding credits) or under regulations made for the
purposes of that section had never been given if:
(a) the notice is revoked; or
(b) the decision to give the notice is set aside.

When funding credits are available
(2) Use this method to work out whether a fund has pre-1 July 88
funding credits available for an income year:
Method statement
Step 1.

Identify the amount of pre-1 July 88 funding credits
unused at the end of the previous income year.

Step 2.

Index that amount.
Note:

Subdivision 960-M shows you how to index amounts.

Step 3.

Add any pre-1 July 88 funding credits transferred to the
fund in the income year under regulations made for the
purposes of subsection 342(7) of the Superannuation
Industry (Supervision) Act 1993.

Step 4.

Deduct from the step 3 amount:
(a)

(b)

pre-1 July 88 funding credits transferred from the
fund in the income year under regulations made for
the purposes of subsection 342(7) of that Act; and
amounts specified in a notice given to the
provider in relation to the fund
under subsection 342(6) of that Act for the income
year.
*superannuation

Step 5.

The result is the pre-1 July 88 funding credits available to
the fund for the income year.
That amount, reduced by any amount specified in a
choice made under subsection (1) for the income year, is
the amount of pre-1 July 88 funding credits unused at the

average value of superannuation liabilities is the average value

(4) The value of particular liabilities of the fund at a particular time is
the amount of the fund’s assets, together with future contributions
in respect of the benefits concerned and expected earnings on the
assets and contributions after that time, that would provide the
amount required to discharge those liabilities as they fall due. This
must be specified in an *actuary’s certificate obtained by the
trustee of the fund before the date for lodgment of the fund’s

(6) The superannuation liabilities do not have to be valued by an
actuary for the income year if the fund has no *segregated current
pension assets or *segregated non-current assets for the income
year. Instead, the value can be worked out using this formula:

reasonably be expected to pay in an *arm’s length transaction to
obtain an insurance policy to cover it for its current or contingent

expected to pay in an arm’s length transaction to obtain an
insurance policy; and
(b) the insurance policy covers liabilities of the fund to provide a
class of total and permanent disability benefits broader than that
covered by section 295-460; and
(c) the insurance policy is specified in the regulations; and
(d) the fund does not have insurance coverage for the liabilities;
the fund may deduct, under subsection (2), so much of that certified
amount as is specified in the regulations.

(2B) The amount is the amount a *complying superannuation fund could
reasonably be expected to pay in an *arm’s length transaction to
obtain an insurance policy specified in the regulations.
Actuary’s certificate
(3) The trustee must obtain an *actuary’s certificate before the date for
lodgment of the fund’s *income tax return for the income year in
order to deduct an amount referred to in item 6 of the table or in

(1) The taxable income of a *complying superannuation entity is split
into a *non-arm’s length component and a *low tax component.
Note:

A concessional rate applies to the low tax component, while the
non-arm’s length component is taxed at the highest marginal rate. The
rates are set out in the Income Tax Rates Act 1986.

(2) If an entity is not of a kind referred to in paragraph 295-550(8)(a)
(about certain small entities), the non-arm’s length component for
an income year is the entity’s *non-arm’s length income for that
year less any deductions to the extent that they are attributable to
that income.
(2A) If the entity is of a kind referred to in paragraph 295-550(8)(a)
(about certain small entities), the non-arm’s length component for
an income year is the lesser of:
(a) the sum of:
(i) each amount of the entity’s *non-arm’s length income
under subsection 295-550(1), (2), (4) or (5) for that year
less any deductions to the extent that they are
attributable to that income; and
(ii) each amount of the entity’s non-arm’s length income
under subsection 295-550(8) or (9) for that year; and
(b) the entity’s taxable income for the income year:
(i) less the contributions that are included in the entity’s
assessable income under Subdivision 295-C for the
income year; and
(ii) plus any deductions to the extent that they are
attributable to those contributions.
(3) The low tax component is any remaining part of the entity’s
taxable income for the income year.

(1) An amount of *ordinary income or *statutory income is non-arm’s
length income of a *complying superannuation entity if, as a result
of a *scheme the parties to which were not dealing with each other
at *arm’s length in relation to the scheme, one or more of the

(a) the amount of the income is more than the amount that the
entity might have been expected to derive if those parties had
been dealing with each other at arm’s length in relation to the
scheme;
(b) if the entity is of a kind referred to in paragraph (8)(a) (about
certain small entities):
(i) in gaining or producing the income, the entity incurs a
loss, outgoing or expenditure of an amount that is less
than the amount of a loss, outgoing or expenditure that
the entity might have been expected to incur if those
parties had been dealing with each other at arm’s length
in relation to the scheme; and
(ii) subsection (8) does not apply to the loss, outgoing or

(2) The RSA component for an income year is worked out in this way:
Method statement
Step 1.

Add these amounts included in the provider’s assessable
income for the income year:
(a)

amounts included under Subdivision 295-C; and

(b)

other amounts credited during the year to *RSAs
that it provides.

Step 2.

Subtract from the step 1 amount amounts paid from those
*RSAs (except benefits for the RSA holders or tax).

Step 3.

The result is the RSA component.

(3) However, if the *RSA component is more than the *RSA
provider’s taxable income:
(a) the provider’s taxable income is equal to that sum; and
(b) this Act applies to the provider as if it had a *tax loss for the
income year of an amount that would have been that loss if
the RSA component were not *ordinary income or *statutory
income.
(4) The standard component is the remaining part (if any) of the *RSA
provider’s taxable income for the income year after subtracting the
*RSA component.

(i) the entitlement, so far as it relates to the old RSA, is met
wholly or partly by the making of a payment to another
RSA (the new RSA) that the person is the holder of

*superannuation interest that those components represent;
and
(b) next, applying those proportions to the benefit.
(2) The *superannuation benefit is taken to be paid in a way such that
each of those components of the benefit bears the same proportion
to the amount of the benefit that the corresponding component of
the *superannuation interest bears to the *value of the
superannuation interest.
Example: The amount of a superannuation lump sum is $100. Just before the
benefit is paid, the value of the superannuation interest was $1000 (of
which $200 was the tax free component and $800 was the taxable
component). For the lump sum, the tax free component is $20 and the
taxable component is $80.

Method statement
Step 1.

Work out the amount (the unclaimed amount) (or
amounts), set out in column 1 of the table in
subsection (3), to which the *superannuation benefit is
attributable.
Note:

A payment made under subsection 17(2) of the

Act 1999 is attributable to a single unclaimed amount set
out in item 1 or 2 of the table.
A payment under subsection 20H(2) or (3) of that Act
may be attributable to more than one unclaimed amount.
A payment under subsection 20QF(2) of that Act is
attributable to a single unclaimed amount set out in
item 3A of the table.
A payment under subsection 21E(2) of that Act is
attributable to a single unclaimed amount set out in
item 3B of the table.
A payment under subsection 22B(2) of that Act is
attributable to a single unclaimed amount set out in
item 3C of the table.
A payment made under subsection 24G(2) of that Act is
attributable to a single unclaimed amount set out in
item 4 of the table.
A payment under subsection 24NA(2) or (3) of that Act
may be attributable to more than one unclaimed amount.

Step 2.

Assume that the unclaimed amount (or each unclaimed
amount), instead of being paid to the Commissioner, had
been paid to the person as the payment (the claimed
equivalent) set out in column 2 of the table.

The effect of excluding such shortfall components from item 3 of the
table in this subsection is that the taxable component includes so much
of the superannuation benefit as is attributable to such a shortfall
component.

Note 2:

The table in this subsection does not cover interest paid by the

(2) The accumulation phase value of an individual’s *superannuation
interest, at a particular time when the interest is not in the
*retirement phase, is:
(a) if the regulations specify that value or a method for
determining that value—that value; or
(b) otherwise—the total amount of the *superannuation benefits
that would become payable if the individual voluntarily
caused the interest to cease at that time.

307-210 Tax free component of superannuation interest
(1) The tax free component of a *superannuation interest is so much of
the *value of the interest as consists of:
(a) the *contributions segment of the interest; and
(b) the *crystallised segment of the interest.
Tax free component reduces if a benefit is paid
(2) If a *superannuation benefit is paid from the *superannuation
interest:
(a) the *crystallised segment of the interest is reduced (but not
below zero) by an amount equal to the *tax free component
of the benefit; and
(b) if any of that amount remains, the *contributions segment of
the interest is reduced (but not below zero) by that remaining
amount.
Note:

This has the effect of reducing the interest’s tax free component by the
amount of the benefit’s tax free component.

Section 307-215
307-215 Taxable component of superannuation interest
The taxable component of a *superannuation interest is the *value
of the interest less the *tax free component of the interest.

307-220 What is the contributions segment?
(1) The contributions segment of a *superannuation interest is the total
amount of the contributions to the interest:
(a) that were made after 30 June 2007; and
(b) to the extent that they have not been and will not be included
in the assessable income of the *superannuation provider in
relation to the *superannuation plan in which the interest is
held.
This section has effect subject to subsection 307-210(2).
Note:

This segment may be reduced if a superannuation benefit is paid from
the superannuation interest: see subsection 307-210(2).

(2) For the purposes of this section:
(a) in determining whether contributions are included in the
contributions segment under subsection (1):
(i) disregard the *taxable component of a *roll-over
superannuation benefit paid into the interest; and
(ia) disregard the *tax free component of an *involuntary
roll-over superannuation benefit paid into the interest
from another superannuation interest (the earlier
interest) (other than an earlier interest that was
supporting a *superannuation income stream
immediately before that benefit was paid); and
(ib) if subparagraph (ia) applies—include as a contribution
an amount equal to the amount referred to in
subsection (5); and
(ii) for a *superannuation plan that is a *constitutionally
protected fund—treat the superannuation plan as if it
were not a constitutionally protected fund; and
(b) disregard section 295-180 and Subdivision 295-D.

Section 307-225
(3) For the purposes of subparagraph (2)(a)(i), treat the *excess
untaxed roll-over amount (if any) of the *roll-over superannuation
benefit as part of the *tax free component of the benefit instead of
the *taxable component of the benefit.
(4) Subparagraph (2)(a)(i) does not apply to a *roll-over
superannuation benefit that is a *departing Australia
superannuation payment made under subsection 20H(2), (2AA) or
(2A) of the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members)
Act 1999.
Note 1:

The whole departing Australia superannuation payment is included in
the contributions segment of the superannuation interest, as none of
the payment has been or will be included in the superannuation
provider’s assessable income.

Note 2:

Including the whole payment in that segment, and thus the tax free
component, of the superannuation interest ensures that the amount of
the payment, which is taxed by the Superannuation (Departing
Australia Superannuation Payments Tax) Act 2007, does not attract
more tax when paid as a superannuation benefit from the interest.

(5) For the purposes of subparagraph (2)(a)(ib), the amount is:
(a) if the *involuntary roll-over superannuation benefit is
covered by paragraph 306-12(a) or (c)—the sum of the
contributions segment, and crystallised segment, of the
earlier interest immediately before the benefit was paid; or
(b) if the benefit is covered by paragraph 306-12(b)—the
proportion of that sum that the benefit was to the *value of
the earlier interest immediately before the benefit was paid.

307-225 What is the crystallised segment?
(1) To work out the crystallised segment of a *superannuation interest,
first assume that:
(a) an eligible termination payment had been made in respect of
the holder of the interest just before 1 July 2007; and
(b) the amount of the eligible termination payment had been
equal to the *value of the interest at that time.

payment:
(a) the concessional component;
(b) the post-June 1994 invalidity component;
(c) the undeducted contributions;

Note:

This segment may be reduced if a superannuation benefit is paid from
the superannuation interest: see subsection 307-210(2).

(3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(e), disregard the *value of the
interest just before 1 July 2007 to the extent that it would consist,
apart from this subsection, of the *element untaxed in the fund of
the *taxable component of a *superannuation benefit constituted by
the eligible termination payment.
(4) In this section, the following terms have the same meaning as in
subsection 27A(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (as in

(b) post-June 1994 invalidity component;
(c) undeducted contributions;
(d) CGT exempt component;
(e) pre-July 83 component;
(f) eligible termination payment.

(1) Your total superannuation balance, at a particular time, is the sum
of the following:

in the *retirement phase—the *accumulation phase values, at
that time, of each such interest;

Note 1:

Section 65AA of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act
1992 requires certain shortfall components to be treated as amounts
paid to the Commissioner under subsection 20F(1) of the
Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999.
The effect of excluding such shortfall components from item 3 of the
table in this subsection is that the element untaxed in the fund includes
so much of the superannuation benefit as is attributable to such a
shortfall component.

Note 2:

The table in this subsection does not cover interest paid by the
Commissioner under subsection 20H(2A) of the Superannuation
(Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999.
The effect of this is that the element untaxed in the fund of the taxable
component includes so much of the superannuation benefit as is
attributable to such interest.

(3A) The element taxed in the fund is nil, if the *superannuation benefit
is paid under subsection 20H(2AA) of the Superannuation
(Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 (interest).
Note:

The taxable component of a superannuation benefit paid by the
Commissioner under subsection 17(2AB) or (2AC), 20QF(5) or (6),
21E(5) or (6), 22B(5) or (6) or 24G(3A) or (3B) of the
Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999, or

temporary resident, is nil: see subsections 307-142(3B) and (4) of this
